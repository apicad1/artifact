PTHREAD_SETCONCURRENCY(3)                       Linux Programmer's Manual                      PTHREAD_SETCONCURRENCY(3)

NAME
       pthread_setconcurrency, pthread_getconcurrency - set/get the concurrency level

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_setconcurrency(int new_level);
       int pthread_getconcurrency(void);

       Compile and link with -pthread.

DESCRIPTION
       The  pthread_setconcurrency() function informs the implementation of the application's desired concurrency level,
       specified in new_level.  The implementation takes this only as a hint: POSIX.1 does not specify the level of con‐
       currency that should be provided as a result of calling pthread_setconcurrency().

       Specifying new_level as 0 instructs the implementation to manage the concurrency level as it deems appropriate.

       pthread_getconcurrency() returns the current value of the concurrency level for this process.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, pthread_setconcurrency() returns 0; on error, it returns a nonzero error number.

       pthread_getconcurrency()  always succeeds, returning the concurrency level set by a previous call to pthread_set‐
       concurrency(), or 0, if pthread_setconcurrency() has not previously been called.

ERRORS
       pthread_setconcurrency() can fail with the following error:

       EINVAL new_level is negative.

       POSIX.1 also documents an EAGAIN error ("the value specified by new_level would cause a system resource to be ex‐
       ceeded").

VERSIONS
       These functions are available in glibc since version 2.1.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008.

NOTES
       The default concurrency level is 0.

       Concurrency  levels  are  meaningful  only  for  M:N threading implementations, where at any moment a subset of a
       process's set of user-level threads may be bound to a smaller number of kernel-scheduling entities.  Setting  the
       concurrency level allows the application to give the system a hint as to the number of kernel-scheduling entities
       that should be provided for efficient execution of the application.

       Both LinuxThreads and NPTL are 1:1 threading implementations, so setting the concurrency level  has  no  meaning.
       In  other words, on Linux these functions merely exist for compatibility with other systems, and they have no ef‐
       fect on the execution of a program.
