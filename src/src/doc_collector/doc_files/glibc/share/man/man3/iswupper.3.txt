ISWUPPER(3)                                     Linux Programmer's Manual                                    ISWUPPER(3)

NAME
       iswupper - test for uppercase wide character

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       int iswupper(wint_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       The  iswupper()  function  is the wide-character equivalent of the isupper(3) function.  It tests whether wc is a
       wide character belonging to the wide-character class "upper".

       The wide-character class "upper" is a subclass of the wide-character class "alpha", and therefore also a subclass
       of the wide-character class "alnum", of the wide-character class "graph" and of the wide-character class "print".

       Being a subclass of the wide-character class "print", the wide-character class "upper" is disjoint from the wide-
       character class "cntrl".

       Being a subclass of the wide-character class "graph", the wide-character class "upper" is disjoint from the wide-
       character class "space" and its subclass "blank".

       Being a subclass of the wide-character class "alnum", the wide-character class "upper" is disjoint from the wide-
       character class "punct".

       Being a subclass of the wide-character class "alpha", the wide-character class "upper" is disjoint from the wide-
       character class "digit".

       The  wide-character  class "upper" contains at least those characters wc which are equal to towupper(wc) and dif‐
       ferent from towlower(wc).

       The wide-character class "upper" always contains at least the letters 'A' to 'Z'.

RETURN VALUE
       The iswupper() function returns nonzero if wc is a wide character belonging to the wide-character class  "upper".
       Otherwise, it returns zero.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, C99.

NOTES
       The behavior of iswupper() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the current locale.

       This function is not very appropriate for dealing with Unicode characters, because Unicode knows about three cas‐
       es: upper, lower, and title case.
