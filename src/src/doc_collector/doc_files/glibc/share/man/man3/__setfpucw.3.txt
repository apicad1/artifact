__SETFPUCW(3)                                   Linux Programmer's Manual                                  __SETFPUCW(3)

NAME
       __setfpucw - set FPU control word on i386 architecture (obsolete)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <i386/fpu_control.h>

       void __setfpucw(unsigned short control_word);

DESCRIPTION
       __setfpucw()  transfers  control_word to the registers of the FPU (floating-point unit) on the i386 architecture.
       This was used to control floating-point precision, rounding and floating-point exceptions.

CONFORMING TO
       This function was a nonstandard GNU extension.

NOTES
       As of glibc 2.1 this function does not exist anymore.  There are new  functions  from  C99,  with  prototypes  in
       <fenv.h>,  to  control FPU rounding modes, like fegetround(3), fesetround(3), and the floating-point environment,
       like fegetenv(3), feholdexcept(3), fesetenv(3), feupdateenv(3),  and  FPU  exception  handling,  like  feclearex‐
       cept(3), fegetexceptflag(3), feraiseexcept(3), fesetexceptflag(3), and fetestexcept(3).

       If  direct  access  to  the FPU control word is still needed, the _FPU_GETCW and _FPU_SETCW macros from <fpu_con‐
       trol.h> can be used.

EXAMPLES
       __setfpucw(0x1372)

       Set FPU control word on the i386 architecture to
            - extended precision
            - rounding to nearest
            - exceptions on overflow, zero divide and NaN
