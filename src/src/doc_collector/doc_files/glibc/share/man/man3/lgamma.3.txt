       signgam:
           _XOPEN_SOURCE
               || /* Since glibc 2.19: */ _DEFAULT_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       For the definition of the Gamma function, see tgamma(3).

       The  lgamma(), lgammaf(), and lgammal() functions return the natural logarithm of the absolute value of the Gamma
       function.  The sign of the Gamma function is returned in the external integer signgam declared in  <math.h>.   It
       is 1 when the Gamma function is positive or zero, -1 when it is negative.

       Since  using  a  constant  location  signgam is not thread-safe, the functions lgamma_r(), lgammaf_r(), and lgam‐
       mal_r() have been introduced; they return the sign via the argument signp.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return the natural logarithm of Gamma(x).

       If x is a NaN, a NaN is returned.

       If x is 1 or 2, +0 is returned.

       If x is positive infinity or negative infinity, positive infinity is returned.

       If x is a nonpositive integer,  a  pole  error  occurs,  and  the  functions  return  +HUGE_VAL,  +HUGE_VALF,  or
       +HUGE_VALL, respectively.

       If  the  result  overflows, a range error occurs, and the functions return HUGE_VAL, HUGE_VALF, or HUGE_VALL, re‐
       spectively, with the correct mathematical sign.

ERRORS
       See math_error(7) for information on how to determine whether an error has occurred when calling these functions.

       The following errors can occur:

       Pole error: x is a nonpositive integer
              errno is set to ERANGE (but see  BUGS).   A  divide-by-zero  floating-point  exception  (FE_DIVBYZERO)  is
              raised.

       Range error: result overflow
              errno is set to ERANGE.  An overflow floating-point exception (FE_OVERFLOW) is raised.

CONFORMING TO
       The  lgamma()  functions  are  specified  in  C99,  POSIX.1-2001,  and  POSIX.1-2008.   signgam  is  specified in
       POSIX.1-2001 and POSIX.1-2008, but not in C99.  The lgamma_r() functions are nonstandard, but present on  several
       other systems.

BUGS
       In  glibc  2.9 and earlier, when a pole error occurs, errno is set to EDOM; instead of the POSIX-mandated ERANGE.
       Since version 2.10, glibc does the right thing.
