REXEC(3)                                        Linux Programmer's Manual                                       REXEC(3)

NAME
       rexec, rexec_af - return stream to a remote command

SYNOPSIS
       #include <netdb.h>

       int rexec(char **ahost, int inport, const char *user,
                 const char *passwd, const char *cmd, int *fd2p);

       int rexec_af(char **ahost, int inport, const char *user,
                    const char *passwd, const char *cmd, int *fd2p,
                    sa_family_t af);

       rexec(), rexec_af():
           Since glibc 2.19:
               _DEFAULT_SOURCE
           In glibc up to and including 2.19:
               _BSD_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       This interface is obsoleted by rcmd(3).

       The  rexec()  function  looks up the host *ahost using gethostbyname(3), returning -1 if the host does not exist.
       Otherwise, *ahost is set to the standard name of the host.  If a username and password are both  specified,  then
       these  are used to authenticate to the foreign host; otherwise the environment and then the .netrc file in user's
       home directory are searched for appropriate information.  If all this fails, the user is prompted for the  infor‐
       mation.

       The  port  inport  specifies  which well-known DARPA Internet port to use for the connection; the call getservby‐
       name("exec", "tcp") (see getservent(3)) will return a pointer to a structure that contains  the  necessary  port.
       The protocol for connection is described in detail in rexecd(8).

       If  the  connection  succeeds, a socket in the Internet domain of type SOCK_STREAM is returned to the caller, and
       given to the remote command as stdin and stdout.  If fd2p is nonzero, then an  auxiliary  channel  to  a  control
       process will be setup, and a file descriptor for it will be placed in *fd2p.  The control process will return di‐
       agnostic output from the command (unit 2) on this channel, and will also accept bytes on this  channel  as  being
       UNIX  signal  numbers,  to be forwarded to the process group of the command.  The diagnostic information returned
       does not include remote authorization failure, as the secondary connection is set up after authorization has been
       verified.   If  fd2p is 0, then the stderr (unit 2 of the remote command) will be made the same as the stdout and
       no provision is made for sending arbitrary signals to the remote process, although you may be able to get its at‐
       tention by using out-of-band data.

   rexec_af()
       The rexec() function works over IPv4 (AF_INET).  By contrast, the rexec_af() function provides an extra argument,
       af, that allows the caller to select the protocol.  This argument can  be  specified  as  AF_INET,  AF_INET6,  or
       AF_UNSPEC (to allow the implementation to select the protocol).

VERSIONS
       The rexec_af() function was added to glibc in version 2.2.

CONFORMING TO
       These  functions  are not in POSIX.1.  The rexec() function first appeared in 4.2BSD, and is present on the BSDs,
       Solaris, and many other systems.  The rexec_af() function is more recent, and less widespread.

BUGS
       The rexec() function sends the unencrypted password across the network.

       The underlying service is considered a big security hole and therefore not enabled on many sites;  see  rexecd(8)
       for explanations.
