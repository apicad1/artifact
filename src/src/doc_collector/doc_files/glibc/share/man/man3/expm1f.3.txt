EXPM1(3)                                        Linux Programmer's Manual                                       EXPM1(3)

NAME
       expm1, expm1f, expm1l - exponential minus 1

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double expm1(double x);
       float expm1f(float x);
       long double expm1l(long double x);

       Link with -lm.

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

           _ISOC99_SOURCE || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L
               || _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500

       expm1f(), expm1l():
           _ISOC99_SOURCE || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L
               || /* Since glibc 2.19: */ _DEFAULT_SOURCE
               || /* Glibc versions <= 2.19: */ _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       These functions return a value equivalent to

           exp(x) - 1

       The  result  is  computed  in  a way that is accurate even if the value of x is near zero—a case where exp(x) - 1
       would be inaccurate due to subtraction of two numbers that are nearly equal.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return exp(x) - 1.

       If x is a NaN, a NaN is returned.

       If x is +0 (-0), +0 (-0) is returned.

       If x is positive infinity, positive infinity is returned.

       If x is negative infinity, -1 is returned.

       If the result overflows, a range error occurs, and the functions return -HUGE_VAL, -HUGE_VALF, or -HUGE_VALL, re‐
       spectively.

ERRORS
       See math_error(7) for information on how to determine whether an error has occurred when calling these functions.

       The following errors can occur:

       Range error, overflow
              errno is set to ERANGE (but see BUGS).  An overflow floating-point exception (FE_OVERFLOW) is raised.

CONFORMING TO
       C99, POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008.

BUGS
       For  some  large  negative  x  values (where the function result approaches -1), expm1() raises a bogus underflow
       floating-point exception.

       For some large positive x values, expm1() raises a bogus invalid floating-point exception in addition to the  ex‐
       pected overflow exception, and returns a NaN instead of positive infinity.

       Before version 2.11, the glibc implementation did not set errno to ERANGE when a range error occurred.
