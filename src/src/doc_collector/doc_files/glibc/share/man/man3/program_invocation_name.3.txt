NAME
       program_invocation_name, program_invocation_short_name - obtain name used to invoke calling program

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE         /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <errno.h>

       extern char *program_invocation_name;
       extern char *program_invocation_short_name;

DESCRIPTION
       program_invocation_name  contains  the name that was used to invoke the calling program.  This is the same as the
       value of argv[0] in main(), with the difference that the scope of program_invocation_name is global.

       program_invocation_short_name contains the basename component of name that was used to invoke  the  calling  pro‚Äê
       gram.   That  is,  it  is  the same value as program_invocation_name, with all text up to and including the final
       slash (/), if any, removed.

       These variables are automatically initialized by the glibc run-time startup code.

CONFORMING TO
       These variables are GNU extensions, and should not be used in programs intended to be portable.

NOTES
       The Linux-specific /proc/[number]/cmdline file provides access to similar information.
