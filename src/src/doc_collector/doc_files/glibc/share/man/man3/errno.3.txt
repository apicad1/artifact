ERRNO(3)                                        Linux Programmer's Manual                                       ERRNO(3)

NAME
       errno - number of last error

SYNOPSIS
       #include <errno.h>

DESCRIPTION
       The <errno.h> header file defines the integer variable errno, which is set by system calls and some library func‐
       tions in the event of an error to indicate what went wrong.

   errno
       The value in errno is significant only when the return value of the call indicated an error (i.e., -1  from  most
       system  calls; -1 or NULL from most library functions); a function that succeeds is allowed to change errno.  The
       value of errno is never set to zero by any system call or library function.

       For some system calls and library functions (e.g., getpriority(2)), -1 is a valid return  on  success.   In  such
       cases,  a  successful  return can be distinguished from an error return by setting errno to zero before the call,
       and then, if the call returns a status that indicates that an error may have occurred, checking to see  if  errno
       has a nonzero value.

       errno  is  defined  by  the  ISO C standard to be a modifiable lvalue of type int, and must not be explicitly de‐
       clared; errno may be a macro.  errno is thread-local; setting it in one thread does not affect its value  in  any
       other thread.

   Error numbers and names
       Valid  error  numbers are all positive numbers.  The <errno.h> header file defines symbolic names for each of the
       possible error numbers that may appear in errno.

       All the error names specified by POSIX.1 must have distinct values, with the exception of EAGAIN and EWOULDBLOCK,
       which may be the same.  On Linux, these two have the same value on all architectures.

       The  error  numbers that correspond to each symbolic name vary across UNIX systems, and even across different ar‐
       chitectures on Linux.  Therefore, numeric values are not included as part of the list of error names below.   The
       perror(3) and strerror(3) functions can be used to convert these names to corresponding textual error messages.

       On  any  particular  Linux  system, one can obtain a list of all symbolic error names and the corresponding error
       numbers using the errno(1) command (part of the moreutils package):

           $ errno -l
           EPERM 1 Operation not permitted
           ENOENT 2 No such file or directory
           ESRCH 3 No such process
           EINTR 4 Interrupted system call
           EIO 5 Input/output error
           ...

       The errno(1) command can also be used to look up individual error numbers and names, and to search for errors us‐
       ing strings from the error description, as in the following examples:

           $ errno 2
           ENOENT 2 No such file or directory
           $ errno ESRCH
           ESRCH 3 No such process
           $ errno -s permission
           EACCES 13 Permission denied

   List of error names
       In the list of the symbolic error names below, various names are marked as follows:

       *  POSIX.1-2001:  The name is defined by POSIX.1-2001, and is defined in later POSIX.1 versions, unless otherwise
          indicated.

       *  POSIX.1-2008: The name is defined in POSIX.1-2008, but was not present in earlier POSIX.1 standards.

       *  C99: The name is defined by C99.

       Below is a list of the symbolic error names that are defined on Linux:

       E2BIG           Argument list too long (POSIX.1-2001).

       EXDEV           Improper link (POSIX.1-2001).

       EXFULL          Exchange full.

NOTES
       A common mistake is to do

           if (somecall() == -1) {
               printf("somecall() failed\n");
               if (errno == ...) { ... }
           }

       where  errno no longer needs to have the value it had upon return from somecall() (i.e., it may have been changed
       by the printf(3)).  If the value of errno should be preserved across a library call, it must be saved:

           if (somecall() == -1) {
               int errsv = errno;
               printf("somecall() failed\n");
               if (errsv == ...) { ... }
           }

       Note that the POSIX threads APIs do not set errno on error.  Instead, on failure they return an error  number  as
       the  function result.  These error numbers have the same meanings as the error numbers returned in errno by other
       APIs.

       On some ancient systems, <errno.h> was not present or did not declare errno, so that it was necessary to  declare
       errno  manually (i.e., extern int errno).  Do not do this.  It long ago ceased to be necessary, and it will cause
       problems with modern versions of the C library.
