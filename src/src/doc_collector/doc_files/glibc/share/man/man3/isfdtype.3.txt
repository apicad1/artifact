ISFDTYPE(3)                                     Linux Programmer's Manual                                    ISFDTYPE(3)

NAME
       isfdtype - test file type of a file descriptor

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/stat.h>
       #include <sys/socket.h>

       int isfdtype(int fd, int fdtype);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       isfdtype():
           Since glibc 2.20:
               _DEFAULT_SOURCE
           Before glibc 2.20:
               _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  isfdtype()  function tests whether the file descriptor fd refers to a file of type fdtype.  The fdtype argu‚Äê
       ment specifies one of the S_IF* constants defined in <sys/stat.h> and documented in stat(2) (e.g., S_IFREG).

RETURN VALUE
       The isfdtype() function returns 1 if the file descriptor fd is of type fdtype and 0 if it is not.  On failure, -1
       is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The isfdtype() function can fail with any of the same errors as fstat(2).

CONFORMING TO
       The  isfdtype()  function is not specified in any standard, but did appear in the draft POSIX.1g standard.  It is
       present on OpenBSD and Tru64 UNIX (where the required header file in both cases is just <sys/stat.h>, as shown in
       the POSIX.1g draft), and possibly other systems.

NOTES
       Portable applications should use fstat(2) instead.
