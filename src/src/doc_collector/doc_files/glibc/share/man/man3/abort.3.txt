ABORT(3)                                        Linux Programmer's Manual                                       ABORT(3)

NAME
       abort - cause abnormal process termination

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       noreturn void abort(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The  abort()  function first unblocks the SIGABRT signal, and then raises that signal for the calling process (as
       though raise(3) was called).  This results in the abnormal termination of the process unless the  SIGABRT  signal
       is caught and the signal handler does not return (see longjmp(3)).

       If  the SIGABRT signal is ignored, or caught by a handler that returns, the abort() function will still terminate
       the process.  It does this by restoring the default disposition for SIGABRT and then raising  the  signal  for  a
       second time.

RETURN VALUE
       The abort() function never returns.

CONFORMING TO

NOTES
       Up until glibc 2.26, if the abort() function caused process termination, all open streams were closed and flushed
       (as with fclose(3)).  However, in some cases this could result in  deadlocks  and  data  corruption.   Therefore,
       starting with glibc 2.27, abort() terminates the process without flushing streams.  POSIX.1 permits either possi‐
       ble behavior, saying that abort() "may include an attempt to effect fclose() on all open streams".
