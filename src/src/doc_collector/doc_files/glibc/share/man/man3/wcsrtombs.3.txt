WCSRTOMBS(3)                                    Linux Programmer's Manual                                   WCSRTOMBS(3)

NAME
       wcsrtombs - convert a wide-character string to a multibyte string

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       size_t wcsrtombs(char *restrict dest, const wchar_t **restrict src,
                        size_t len, mbstate_t *restrict ps);

DESCRIPTION
       If  dest  is  not  NULL,  the  wcsrtombs() function converts the wide-character string *src to a multibyte string
       starting at dest.  At most len bytes are written to dest.  The shift state *ps is updated.  The conversion is ef‐
       fectively performed by repeatedly calling wcrtomb(dest, *src, ps), as long as this call succeeds, and then incre‐
       menting dest by the number of bytes written and *src by one.  The conversion can stop for three reasons:

       1. A wide character has been encountered that can not be represented as a multibyte sequence  (according  to  the
          current  locale).  In this case, *src is left pointing to the invalid wide character, (size_t) -1 is returned,
          and errno is set to EILSEQ.

       2. The length limit forces a stop.  In this case, *src is left pointing to the next wide  character  to  be  con‐
          verted, and the number of bytes written to dest is returned.

       3. The  wide-character  string  has  been  completely  converted,  including  the terminating null wide character
          (L'\0'), which has the side effect of bringing back *ps to the initial state.  In this case, *src  is  set  to
          NULL, and the number of bytes written to dest, excluding the terminating null byte ('\0'), is returned.

       If  dest  is  NULL, len is ignored, and the conversion proceeds as above, except that the converted bytes are not
       written out to memory, and that no length limit exists.

       In both of the above cases, if ps is NULL, a static anonymous state known only to  the  wcsrtombs()  function  is
       used instead.

       The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least len bytes at dest.

RETURN VALUE
       The  wcsrtombs()  function returns the number of bytes that make up the converted part of multibyte sequence, not
       including the terminating null byte.  If  a  wide  character  was  encountered  which  could  not  be  converted,
       (size_t) -1 is returned, and errno set to EILSEQ.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, C99.

NOTES
       The behavior of wcsrtombs() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the current locale.

       Passing NULL as ps is not multithread safe.
