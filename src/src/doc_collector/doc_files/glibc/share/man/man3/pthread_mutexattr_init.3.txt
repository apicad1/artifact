PTHREAD_MUTEXATTR_INIT(3)                       Linux Programmer's Manual                      PTHREAD_MUTEXATTR_INIT(3)

NAME
       pthread_mutexattr_init, pthread_mutexattr_destroy - initialize and destroy a mutex attributes object

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_mutexattr_init(pthread_mutexattr_t *attr);
       int pthread_mutexattr_destroy(pthread_mutexattr_t *attr);

       Compile and link with -pthread.

DESCRIPTION
       The  pthread_mutexattr_init()  function  initializes  the mutex attributes object pointed to by attr with default
       values for all attributes defined by the implementation.

       The results of initializing an already initialized mutex attributes object are undefined.

       The pthread_mutexattr_destroy() function destroys a mutex attribute object (making it uninitialized).  Once a mu‚Äê
       tex attributes object has been destroyed, it can be reinitialized with pthread_mutexattr_init().

       The results of destroying an uninitialized mutex attributes object are undefined.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return 0.  On error, they return a positive error number.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008.

NOTES
       Subsequent changes to a mutex attributes object do not affect mutex that have already been initialized using that
       object.
