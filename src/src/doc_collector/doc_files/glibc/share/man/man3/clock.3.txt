CLOCK(3)                                        Linux Programmer's Manual                                       CLOCK(3)

NAME
       clock - determine processor time

SYNOPSIS
       #include <time.h>

       clock_t clock(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The clock() function returns an approximation of processor time used by the program.

RETURN VALUE
       The  value  returned  is  the  CPU  time  used  so far as a clock_t; to get the number of seconds used, divide by
       CLOCKS_PER_SEC.  If the processor time used is not available or its value cannot be represented, the function re‐
       turns the value (clock_t) -1.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001,  POSIX.1-2008, C89, C99.  XSI requires that CLOCKS_PER_SEC equals 1000000 independent of the actual
       resolution.

NOTES
       The C standard allows for arbitrary values at the start of the program; subtract the value returned from  a  call
       to clock() at the start of the program to get maximum portability.

       Note  that  the  time can wrap around.  On a 32-bit system where CLOCKS_PER_SEC equals 1000000 this function will
       return the same value approximately every 72 minutes.

       On several other implementations, the value returned by clock() also includes the times  of  any  children  whose
       status  has  been collected via wait(2) (or another wait-type call).  Linux does not include the times of waited-
       for children in the value returned by clock().  The times(2) function, which explicitly returns (separate) infor‐
       mation about the caller and its children, may be preferable.

       In  glibc 2.17 and earlier, clock() was implemented on top of times(2).  For improved accuracy, since glibc 2.18,
       it is implemented on top of clock_gettime(2) (using the CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID clock).
