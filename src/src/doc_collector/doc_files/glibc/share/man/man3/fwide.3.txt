FWIDE(3)                                        Linux Programmer's Manual                                       FWIDE(3)

NAME
       fwide - set and determine the orientation of a FILE stream

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       int fwide(FILE *stream, int mode);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       fwide():
           _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500 || _ISOC99_SOURCE
               || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L

DESCRIPTION
       When  mode  is  zero,  the  fwide() function determines the current orientation of stream.  It returns a positive
       value if stream is wide-character oriented, that is, if wide-character I/O is permitted but char  I/O  is  disal‐
       lowed.  It returns a negative value if stream is byte oriented—that is, if char I/O is permitted but wide-charac‐
       ter I/O is disallowed.  It returns zero if stream has no orientation yet; in this case  the  next  I/O  operation
       might change the orientation (to byte oriented if it is a char I/O operation, or to wide-character oriented if it
       is a wide-character I/O operation).

       Once a stream has an orientation, it cannot be changed and persists until the stream is closed.

       When mode is nonzero, the fwide() function first attempts to set stream's orientation (to wide-character oriented
       if  mode  is  greater  than 0, or to byte oriented if mode is less than 0).  It then returns a value denoting the
       current orientation, as above.

RETURN VALUE
       The fwide() function returns the stream's orientation, after possibly changing it.  A positive return value means
       wide-character oriented.  A negative return value means byte oriented.  A return value of zero means undecided.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, C99.

NOTES
       Wide-character output to a byte oriented stream can be performed through the fprintf(3) function with the %lc and
       %ls directives.

       Char oriented output to a wide-character oriented stream can be performed through the fwprintf(3)  function  with
       the %c and %s directives.
