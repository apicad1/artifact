MBSINIT(3)                                      Linux Programmer's Manual                                     MBSINIT(3)

NAME
       mbsinit - test for initial shift state

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       int mbsinit(const mbstate_t *ps);

DESCRIPTION
       Character  conversion  between the multibyte representation and the wide character representation uses conversion
       state, of type mbstate_t.  Conversion of a string uses a finite-state machine; when it is interrupted  after  the
       complete  conversion  of a number of characters, it may need to save a state for processing the remaining charac‐
       ters.  Such a conversion state is needed for the sake of encodings such as ISO-2022 and UTF-7.

       The initial state is the state at the beginning of conversion of a string.  There are two kinds of state: the one
       used  by multibyte to wide character conversion functions, such as mbsrtowcs(3), and the one used by wide charac‐
       ter to multibyte conversion functions, such as wcsrtombs(3), but they both fit in a mbstate_t, and they both have
       the same representation for an initial state.

       For  8-bit encodings, all states are equivalent to the initial state.  For multibyte encodings like UTF-8, EUC-*,
       BIG5, or SJIS, the wide character to multibyte conversion functions never produce  non-initial  states,  but  the
       multibyte  to  wide-character conversion functions like mbrtowc(3) do produce non-initial states when interrupted
       in the middle of a character.

       One possible way to create an mbstate_t in initial state is to set it to zero:

           mbstate_t state;
           memset(&state, 0, sizeof(state));

       On Linux, the following works as well, but might generate compiler warnings:

           mbstate_t state = { 0 };

       The function mbsinit() tests whether *ps corresponds to an initial state.

RETURN VALUE
       mbsinit() returns nonzero if *ps is an initial state, or if ps is NULL.  Otherwise, it returns 0.

CONFORMING TO

NOTES
       The behavior of mbsinit() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the current locale.
