.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The function
.BR fileno ()
examines the argument
.I stream
and returns the integer file descriptor used to implement this stream.
The file descriptor is still owned by
.I stream
and will be closed when
.BR fclose (3)
is called.
Duplicate the file descriptor with
.BR dup (2)
before passing it to code that might close it.
.PP
For the nonlocking counterpart, see
.BR unlocked_stdio (3).
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success,
.BR fileno ()
returns the file descriptor associated with
.IR stream .
On failure, \-1 is returned and
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EBADF
.I stream
is not associated with a file.
