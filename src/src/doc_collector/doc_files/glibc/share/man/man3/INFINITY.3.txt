INFINITY(3)                                     Linux Programmer's Manual                                    INFINITY(3)

NAME
       INFINITY, NAN, HUGE_VAL, HUGE_VALF, HUGE_VALL - floating-point constants

SYNOPSIS
       #define _ISOC99_SOURCE      /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <math.h>

       INFINITY

       NAN

       HUGE_VAL
       HUGE_VALF
       HUGE_VALL

DESCRIPTION
       The macro INFINITY expands to a float constant representing positive infinity.

       The macro NAN expands to a float constant representing a quiet NaN (when supported).  A quiet NaN is a NaN ("not-
       a-number") that does not raise exceptions when it is used in arithmetic.  The opposite is a signaling  NaN.   See
       IEC 60559:1989.

       The  macros  HUGE_VAL,  HUGE_VALF, HUGE_VALL expand to constants of types double, float, and long double, respec‚Äê
       tively, that represent a large positive value, possibly positive infinity.

CONFORMING TO
       C99.

       On a glibc system, the macro HUGE_VAL is always available.  Availability of the NAN macro  can  be  tested  using
       #ifdef NAN, and similarly for INFINITY, HUGE_VALF, HUGE_VALL.  They will be defined by <math.h> if _ISOC99_SOURCE
       or _GNU_SOURCE is defined, or __STDC_VERSION__ is defined and has a value not less than 199901L.
