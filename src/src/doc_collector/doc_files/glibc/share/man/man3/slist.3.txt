DESCRIPTION
       These macros define and operate on doubly linked lists.

       In  the  macro  definitions,  TYPE  is  the  name  of a user-defined structure, that must contain a field of type
       SLIST_ENTRY, named NAME.  The argument HEADNAME is the name of a user-defined structure that must be declared us‐
       ing the macro SLIST_HEAD().

   Creation
       A  singly linked list is headed by a structure defined by the SLIST_HEAD() macro.  This structure contains a sin‐
       gle pointer to the first element on the list.  The elements are singly linked for minimum space and  pointer  ma‐
       nipulation overhead at the expense of O(n) removal for arbitrary elements.  New elements can be added to the list
       after an existing element or at the head of the list.  An SLIST_HEAD structure is declared as follows:

           SLIST_HEAD(HEADNAME, TYPE) head;

       where struct HEADNAME is the structure to be defined, and struct TYPE is the type of the elements  to  be  linked
       into the list.  A pointer to the head of the list can later be declared as:

           struct HEADNAME *headp;

       (The names head and headp are user selectable.)

       SLIST_ENTRY() declares a structure that connects the elements in the list.

       SLIST_HEAD_INITIALIZER() evaluates to an initializer for the list head.

       SLIST_INIT() initializes the list referenced by head.

       SLIST_EMPTY() evaluates to true if there are no elements in the list.

   Insertion
       SLIST_INSERT_HEAD() inserts the new element elm at the head of the list.

       SLIST_INSERT_AFTER() inserts the new element elm after the element listelm.

   Traversal
       SLIST_FIRST() returns the first element in the list, or NULL if the list is empty.

       SLIST_NEXT() returns the next element in the list.

       SLIST_FOREACH() traverses the list referenced by head in the forward direction, assigning each element in turn to
       var.

   Removal
       SLIST_REMOVE() removes the element elm from the list.

       SLIST_REMOVE_HEAD() removes the element elm from the head of the list.  For optimum  efficiency,  elements  being
       removed from the head of the list should explicitly use this macro instead of the generic SLIST_REMOVE().

RETURN VALUE
       SLIST_EMPTY() returns nonzero if the list is empty, and zero if the list contains at least one entry.

       SLIST_FIRST(), and SLIST_NEXT() return a pointer to the first or next TYPE structure, respectively.

       SLIST_HEAD_INITIALIZER() returns an initializer that can be assigned to the list head.

CONFORMING TO
       Not in POSIX.1, POSIX.1-2001, or POSIX.1-2008.  Present on the BSDs (SLIST macros first appeared in 4.4BSD).

BUGS
       SLIST_FOREACH()  doesn't allow var to be removed or freed within the loop, as it would interfere with the traver‐
       sal.  SLIST_FOREACH_SAFE(), which is present on the BSDs but is not present in glibc, fixes  this  limitation  by
       allowing  var to safely be removed from the list and freed from within the loop without interfering with the tra‐
       versal.

EXAMPLES
       #include <stddef.h>
       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <stdlib.h>
       #include <sys/queue.h>

       struct entry {
           int data;
           SLIST_ENTRY(entry) entries;             /* Singly linked list */
       };

       SLIST_HEAD(slisthead, entry);

       int
       main(void)
       {
           struct entry *n1, *n2, *n3, *np;
           struct slisthead head;                  /* Singly linked list
                                                      head */

           SLIST_INIT(&head);                      /* Initialize the queue */

           n1 = malloc(sizeof(struct entry));      /* Insert at the head */
           SLIST_INSERT_HEAD(&head, n1, entries);

           n2 = malloc(sizeof(struct entry));      /* Insert after */
           SLIST_INSERT_AFTER(n1, n2, entries);

           SLIST_REMOVE(&head, n2, entry, entries);/* Deletion */
           free(n2);

           n3 = SLIST_FIRST(&head);
           SLIST_REMOVE_HEAD(&head, entries);      /* Deletion from the head */
           free(n3);

           for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
               n1 = malloc(sizeof(struct entry));
               SLIST_INSERT_HEAD(&head, n1, entries);
               n1->data = i;
           }

                                                   /* Forward traversal */
           SLIST_FOREACH(np, &head, entries)
               printf("%i\n", np->data);

           while (!SLIST_EMPTY(&head)) {           /* List deletion */
               n1 = SLIST_FIRST(&head);
               SLIST_REMOVE_HEAD(&head, entries);
               free(n1);
           }
           SLIST_INIT(&head);

           exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
       }
