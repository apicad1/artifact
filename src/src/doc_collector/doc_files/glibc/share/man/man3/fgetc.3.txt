FGETC(3)                                        Linux Programmer's Manual                                       FGETC(3)

NAME
       fgetc, fgets, getc, getchar, ungetc - input of characters and strings

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>

       int fgetc(FILE *stream);
       int getc(FILE *stream);
       int getchar(void);

       char *fgets(char *restrict s, int size, FILE *restrict stream);

       int ungetc(int c, FILE *stream);

DESCRIPTION
       fgetc()  reads the next character from stream and returns it as an unsigned char cast to an int, or EOF on end of
       file or error.

       getc() is equivalent to fgetc() except that it may be implemented as a macro which  evaluates  stream  more  than
       once.

       getchar() is equivalent to getc(stdin).

       fgets()  reads in at most one less than size characters from stream and stores them into the buffer pointed to by
       s.  Reading stops after an EOF or a newline.  If a newline is read, it is stored into the buffer.  A  terminating
       null byte ('\0') is stored after the last character in the buffer.

       ungetc()  pushes  c  back to stream, cast to unsigned char, where it is available for subsequent read operations.
       Pushed-back characters will be returned in reverse order; only one pushback is guaranteed.

       Calls to the functions described here can be mixed with each other and with calls to other input  functions  from
       the stdio library for the same input stream.

       For nonlocking counterparts, see unlocked_stdio(3).

RETURN VALUE
       fgetc(), getc(), and getchar() return the character read as an unsigned char cast to an int or EOF on end of file
       or error.

       fgets() returns s on success, and NULL on error or when end of file occurs while no characters have been read.

       ungetc() returns c on success, or EOF on error.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, C89, C99.

       It is not advisable to mix calls to input functions from the stdio library with low-level calls  to  read(2)  for
       the  file  descriptor  associated with the input stream; the results will be undefined and very probably not what
       you want.
