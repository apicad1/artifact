PTHREAD_DETACH(3)                               Linux Programmer's Manual                              PTHREAD_DETACH(3)

NAME
       pthread_detach - detach a thread

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_detach(pthread_t thread);

       Compile and link with -pthread.

DESCRIPTION
       The  pthread_detach()  function marks the thread identified by thread as detached.  When a detached thread termi‐
       nates, its resources are automatically released back to the system without the need for another  thread  to  join
       with the terminated thread.

       Attempting to detach an already detached thread results in unspecified behavior.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, pthread_detach() returns 0; on error, it returns an error number.

ERRORS
       EINVAL thread is not a joinable thread.

       ESRCH  No thread with the ID thread could be found.

       For an explanation of the terms used in this section, see attributes(7).

NOTES
       Once a thread has been detached, it can't be joined with pthread_join(3) or be made joinable again.

       A  new  thread can be created in a detached state using pthread_attr_setdetachstate(3) to set the detached attri‐
       bute of the attr argument of pthread_create(3).

       The detached attribute merely determines the behavior of the system when the thread terminates; it does not  pre‐
       vent  the  thread  from  being  terminated  if the process terminates using exit(3) (or equivalently, if the main
       thread returns).

       Either pthread_join(3) or pthread_detach() should be called for each thread that an application creates, so  that
       system  resources  for  the thread can be released.  (But note that the resources of any threads for which one of
       these actions has not been done will be freed when the process terminates.)

EXAMPLES
       The following statement detaches the calling thread:

           pthread_detach(pthread_self());
