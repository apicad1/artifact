TIMEGM(3)                                       Linux Programmer's Manual                                      TIMEGM(3)

NAME
       timegm, timelocal - inverses of gmtime and localtime

SYNOPSIS
       #include <time.h>

       time_t timelocal(struct tm *tm);

       time_t timegm(struct tm *tm);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       timelocal(), timegm():
           Since glibc 2.19:
               _DEFAULT_SOURCE
           Glibc 2.19 and earlier:
               _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  functions  timelocal()  and  timegm() are the inverses of localtime(3) and gmtime(3).  Both functions take a
       broken-down time and convert it to calendar time (seconds since the Epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000, UTC).   The
       difference  between  the  two  functions is that timelocal() takes the local timezone into account when doing the
       conversion, while timegm() takes the input value to be Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return the calendar time (seconds since the Epoch), expressed  as  a  value  of  type
       time_t.  On error, they return the value (time_t) -1 and set errno to indicate the cause of the error.

ERRORS
       EOVERFLOW
              The result cannot be represented.

CONFORMING TO
       These functions are nonstandard GNU extensions that are also present on the BSDs.  Avoid their use.

NOTES
       The  timelocal() function is equivalent to the POSIX standard function mktime(3).  There is no reason to ever use
       it.
