NAME
       drem, dremf, dreml, remainder, remainderf, remainderl - floating-point remainder function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       /* The C99 versions */
       double remainder(double x, double y);
       float remainderf(float x, float y);
       long double remainderl(long double x, long double y);

       /* Obsolete synonyms */
       double drem(double x, double y);
       float dremf(float x, float y);
       long double dreml(long double x, long double y);

       Link with -lm.

DESCRIPTION
       These functions compute the remainder of dividing x by y.  The return value is x-n*y, where n is the value x / y,
       rounded to the nearest integer.  If the absolute value of x-n*y is 0.5, n is chosen to be even.

       These functions are unaffected by the current rounding mode (see fenv(3)).

       The drem() function does precisely the same thing.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return the floating-point remainder, x-n*y.  If the return value is  0,  it  has  the
       sign of x.

       If x or y is a NaN, a NaN is returned.

       If x is an infinity, and y is not a NaN, a domain error occurs, and a NaN is returned.

       If y is zero, and x is not a NaN, a domain error occurs, and a NaN is returned.

ERRORS
       See math_error(7) for information on how to determine whether an error has occurred when calling these functions.

       The following errors can occur:

       Domain error: x is an infinity and y is not a NaN
              errno is set to EDOM (but see BUGS).  An invalid floating-point exception (FE_INVALID) is raised.

              These functions do not set errno for this case.

       Domain error: y is zero
              errno is set to EDOM.  An invalid floating-point exception (FE_INVALID) is raised.

CONFORMING TO
       The functions remainder(), remainderf(), and remainderl() are specified in C99, POSIX.1-2001, and POSIX.1-2008.

       The  function  drem()  is from 4.3BSD.  The float and long double variants dremf() and dreml() exist on some sys‐
       tems, such as Tru64 and glibc2.  Avoid the use of these functions in favor of remainder() etc.

BUGS
       Before glibc 2.15, the call

           remainder(nan(""), 0);

       returned a NaN, as expected, but wrongly caused a domain error.  Since glibc 2.15, a silent NaN (i.e., no  domain
       error) is returned.

       Before  glibc 2.15, errno was not set to EDOM for the domain error that occurs when x is an infinity and y is not
       a NaN.

EXAMPLE
       The call "remainder(29.0, 3.0)" returns -1.
