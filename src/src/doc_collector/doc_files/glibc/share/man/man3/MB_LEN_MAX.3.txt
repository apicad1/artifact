MB_LEN_MAX(3)                                   Linux Programmer's Manual                                  MB_LEN_MAX(3)

NAME
       MB_LEN_MAX - maximum multibyte length of a character across all locales

SYNOPSIS
       #include <limits.h>

DESCRIPTION
       The  MB_LEN_MAX  macro  is the maximum number of bytes needed to represent a single wide character, in any of the
       supported locales.

RETURN VALUE
       A constant integer greater than zero.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, C99.

NOTES
       The entities MB_LEN_MAX and sizeof(wchar_t) are totally unrelated.  In glibc, MB_LEN_MAX is typically  16  (6  in
       glibc versions earlier than 2.2), while sizeof(wchar_t) is 4.

SEE ALSO
       MB_CUR_MAX(3)
