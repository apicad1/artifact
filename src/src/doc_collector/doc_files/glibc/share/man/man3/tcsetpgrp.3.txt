TCGETPGRP(3)                                    Linux Programmer's Manual                                   TCGETPGRP(3)

NAME
       tcgetpgrp, tcsetpgrp - get and set terminal foreground process group

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       pid_t tcgetpgrp(int fd);

       int tcsetpgrp(int fd, pid_t pgrp);

DESCRIPTION
       The  function tcgetpgrp() returns the process group ID of the foreground process group on the terminal associated
       to fd, which must be the controlling terminal of the calling process.

       The function tcsetpgrp() makes the process group with process group ID pgrp the foreground process group  on  the
       terminal associated to fd, which must be the controlling terminal of the calling process, and still be associated
       with its session.  Moreover, pgrp must be a (nonempty) process group belonging to the same session as the calling
       process.

       If tcsetpgrp() is called by a member of a background process group in its session, and the calling process is not
       blocking or ignoring SIGTTOU, a SIGTTOU signal is sent to all members of this background process group.

RETURN VALUE
       When fd refers to the controlling terminal of the calling process, the function tcgetpgrp() will return the fore‐
       ground  process  group  ID of that terminal if there is one, and some value larger than 1 that is not presently a
       process group ID otherwise.  When fd does not refer to the controlling terminal of the calling process, -1 is re‐
       turned, and errno is set appropriately.

       When successful, tcsetpgrp() returns 0.  Otherwise, it returns -1, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EBADF  fd is not a valid file descriptor.

       EINVAL pgrp has an unsupported value.

       ENOTTY The calling process does not have a controlling terminal, or it has one but it is not described by fd, or,
              for tcsetpgrp(), this controlling terminal is no  longer  associated  with  the  session  of  the  calling
              process.

       EPERM  pgrp  has a supported value, but is not the process group ID of a process in the same session as the call‐
              ing process.
