USELOCALE(3)                                    Linux Programmer's Manual                                   USELOCALE(3)

NAME
       uselocale - set/get the locale for the calling thread

SYNOPSIS
       #include <locale.h>

       locale_t uselocale(locale_t newloc);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       uselocale():
           Since glibc 2.10:
               _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 700
           Before glibc 2.10:
               _GNU_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The uselocale() function sets the current locale for the calling thread, and returns the thread's previously cur‐
       rent locale.  After a successful call to uselocale(), any calls by this thread to functions that  depend  on  the
       locale will operate as though the locale has been set to newloc.

       The newloc argument can have one of the following values:

       A handle returned by a call to newlocale(3) or duplocale(3)
              The calling thread's current locale is set to the specified locale.

       The special locale object handle LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE
              The calling thread's current locale is set to the global locale determined by setlocale(3).

       (locale_t) 0
              The  calling thread's current locale is left unchanged (and the current locale is returned as the function
              result).

RETURN VALUE
       On success, uselocale() returns the locale handle that was set by  the  previous  call  to  uselocale()  in  this
       thread,  or LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE if there was no such previous call.  On error, it returns (locale_t) 0, and sets er‐
       rno to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EINVAL newloc does not refer to a valid locale object.

VERSIONS
       The uselocale() function first appeared in version 2.3 of the GNU C library.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2008.

NOTES
       Unlike setlocale(3), uselocale() does not allow selective replacement of individual locale categories.  To employ
       a  locale  that  differs  in  only a few categories from the current locale, use calls to duplocale(3) and newlo‐
       cale(3) to obtain a locale object equivalent to the current locale and modify the desired categories in that  ob‐
       ject.

EXAMPLES
       See newlocale(3) and duplocale(3).
