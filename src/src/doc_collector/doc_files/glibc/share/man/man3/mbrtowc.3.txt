MBRTOWC(3)                                      Linux Programmer's Manual                                     MBRTOWC(3)

NAME
       mbrtowc - convert a multibyte sequence to a wide character

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       size_t mbrtowc(wchar_t *restrict pwc, const char *restrict s, size_t n,
                      mbstate_t *restrict ps);

DESCRIPTION
       The  main case for this function is when s is not NULL and pwc is not NULL.  In this case, the mbrtowc() function
       inspects at most n bytes of the multibyte string starting at s, extracts the next complete  multibyte  character,
       converts  it  to  a wide character and stores it at *pwc.  It updates the shift state *ps.  If the converted wide
       character is not L'\0' (the null wide character), it returns the number of bytes that were consumed from  s.   If
       the converted wide character is L'\0', it resets the shift state *ps to the initial state and returns 0.

       If  the n bytes starting at s do not contain a complete multibyte character, mbrtowc() returns (size_t) -2.  This
       can happen even if n >= MB_CUR_MAX, if the multibyte string contains redundant shift sequences.

       If the multibyte string starting at s contains an invalid multibyte sequence before the next complete  character,
       mbrtowc() returns (size_t) -1 and sets errno to EILSEQ.  In this case, the effects on *ps are undefined.

       A  different  case is when s is not NULL but pwc is NULL.  In this case, the mbrtowc() function behaves as above,
       except that it does not store the converted wide character in memory.

       A third case is when s is NULL.  In this case, pwc and n are ignored.  If the conversion state represented by *ps
       denotes  an  incomplete multibyte character conversion, the mbrtowc() function returns (size_t) -1, sets errno to
       EILSEQ, and leaves *ps in an undefined state.  Otherwise, the mbrtowc() function puts *ps in  the  initial  state
       and returns 0.

       In  all  of the above cases, if ps is NULL, a static anonymous state known only to the mbrtowc() function is used
       instead.  Otherwise, *ps must be a valid mbstate_t object.  An mbstate_t object a can be initialized to the  ini‐
       tial state by zeroing it, for example using

           memset(&a, 0, sizeof(a));

RETURN VALUE
       The  mbrtowc()  function  returns the number of bytes parsed from the multibyte sequence starting at s, if a non-
       L'\0' wide character was recognized.  It returns 0, if  a  L'\0'  wide  character  was  recognized.   It  returns
       (size_t) -1  and  sets errno to EILSEQ, if an invalid multibyte sequence was encountered.  It returns (size_t) -2
       if it couldn't parse a complete multibyte character, meaning that n should be increased.
