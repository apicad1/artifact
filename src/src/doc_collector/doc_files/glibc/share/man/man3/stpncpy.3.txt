STPNCPY(3)                                      Linux Programmer's Manual                                     STPNCPY(3)

NAME
       stpncpy - copy a fixed-size string, returning a pointer to its end

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       char *stpncpy(char *restrict dest, const char *restrict src, size_t n);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       stpncpy():
           Since glibc 2.10:
               _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L
           Before glibc 2.10:
               _GNU_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  stpncpy()  function copies at most n characters from the string pointed to by src, including the terminating
       null byte ('\0'), to the array pointed to by dest.  Exactly n characters are written  at  dest.   If  the  length
       strlen(src)  is  smaller  than  n,  the remaining characters in the array pointed to by dest are filled with null
       bytes ('\0'), If the length strlen(src) is greater than or equal to n, the string pointed to by dest will not  be
       null-terminated.

       The strings may not overlap.

       The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least n characters at dest.

RETURN VALUE
       stpncpy() returns a pointer to the terminating null byte in dest, or, if dest is not null-terminated, dest+n.
