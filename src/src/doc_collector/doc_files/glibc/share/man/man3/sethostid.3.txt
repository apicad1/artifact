GETHOSTID(3)                                    Linux Programmer's Manual                                   GETHOSTID(3)

NAME
       gethostid, sethostid - get or set the unique identifier of the current host

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       long gethostid(void);
       int sethostid(long hostid);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       gethostid():
           _BSD_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500
       sethostid():
           Since glibc 2.21:
               _DEFAULT_SOURCE
           In glibc 2.19 and 2.20:
               _DEFAULT_SOURCE || (_XOPEN_SOURCE && _XOPEN_SOURCE < 500)
           Up to and including glibc 2.19:
               _BSD_SOURCE || (_XOPEN_SOURCE && _XOPEN_SOURCE < 500)

DESCRIPTION
       gethostid()  and  sethostid()  respectively  get  or set a unique 32-bit identifier for the current machine.  The
       32-bit identifier is intended to be unique among all UNIX systems in existence.  This normally resembles the  In‐
       ternet address for the local machine, as returned by gethostbyname(3), and thus usually never needs to be set.

       The sethostid() call is restricted to the superuser.

RETURN VALUE
       gethostid() returns the 32-bit identifier for the current host as set by sethostid().

       On success, sethostid() returns 0; on error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       sethostid() can fail with the following errors:

       EACCES The caller did not have permission to write to the file used to store the host ID.

       EPERM  The calling process's effective user or group ID is not the same as its corresponding real ID.

CONFORMING TO
       4.2BSD; these functions were dropped in 4.4BSD.  SVr4 includes gethostid() but not sethostid().

       POSIX.1-2001 and POSIX.1-2008 specify gethostid() but not sethostid().

NOTES
       In  the  glibc  implementation, the hostid is stored in the file /etc/hostid.  (In glibc versions before 2.2, the
       file /var/adm/hostid was used.)

       In the glibc implementation, if gethostid() cannot open the file containing the host  ID,  then  it  obtains  the
       hostname  using gethostname(2), passes that hostname to gethostbyname_r(3) in order to obtain the host's IPv4 ad‐
       dress, and returns a value obtained by bit-twiddling the IPv4 address.  (This value may not be unique.)

BUGS
       It is impossible to ensure that the identifier is globally unique.
