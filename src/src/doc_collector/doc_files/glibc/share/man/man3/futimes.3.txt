FUTIMES(3)                                      Linux Programmer's Manual                                     FUTIMES(3)

NAME
       futimes, lutimes - change file timestamps

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/time.h>

       int futimes(int fd, const struct timeval tv[2]);
       int lutimes(const char *filename, const struct timeval tv[2]);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       futimes(), lutimes():
           Since glibc 2.19:
               _DEFAULT_SOURCE
           Glibc 2.19 and earlier:
               _BSD_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       futimes()  changes  the access and modification times of a file in the same way as utimes(2), with the difference
       that the file whose timestamps are to be changed is specified via a file descriptor, fd, rather than via a  path‐
       name.

       lutimes()  changes  the access and modification times of a file in the same way as utimes(2), with the difference
       that if filename refers to a symbolic link, then the link is not dereferenced: instead,  the  timestamps  of  the
       symbolic link are changed.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       Errors are as for utimes(2), with the following additions for futimes():

       EBADF  fd is not a valid file descriptor.

       ENOSYS The /proc filesystem could not be accessed.

       The following additional error may occur for lutimes():

       ENOSYS The kernel does not support this call; Linux 2.6.22 or later is required.

VERSIONS
       futimes()  is  available  since  glibc 2.3.  lutimes() is available since glibc 2.6, and is implemented using the
       utimensat(2) system call, which is supported since kernel 2.6.22.
