.TH MALLINFO 3  2021-03-22 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
mallinfo, mallinfo2 \- obtain memory allocation information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <malloc.h>
.PP
.B struct mallinfo mallinfo(void);
.B struct mallinfo2 mallinfo2(void);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions return a copy of a structure containing information about
memory allocations performed by
.BR malloc (3)
and related functions.
The structure returned by each function contains the same fields.
However, the older function,
.BR mallinfo (),
is deprecated since the type used for the fields is too small (see BUGS).
.PP
Note that not all allocations are visible to these functions;
see BUGS and consider using
.BR malloc_info (3)
instead.
.PP
The
.I mallinfo2
structure returned by
.BR mallinfo2 ()
is defined as follows:
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
struct mallinfo2 {
    size_t arena;     /* Non\-mmapped space allocated (bytes) */
    size_t ordblks;   /* Number of free chunks */
    size_t smblks;    /* Number of free fastbin blocks */
    size_t hblks;     /* Number of mmapped regions */
    size_t hblkhd;    /* Space allocated in mmapped regions
                         (bytes) */
    size_t usmblks;   /* See below */
    size_t fsmblks;   /* Space in freed fastbin blocks (bytes) */
    size_t uordblks;  /* Total allocated space (bytes) */
    size_t fordblks;  /* Total free space (bytes) */
    size_t keepcost;  /* Top\-most, releasable space (bytes) */
};
.EE
.in
.PP
The
.I mallinfo
structure returned by the deprecated
.BR mallinfo ()
function is exactly the same, except that the fields are typed as
.IR int .
.PP
The structure fields contain the following information:
.TP 10
.I arena
The total amount of memory allocated by means other than
.BR mmap (2)
(i.e., memory allocated on the heap).
This figure includes both in-use blocks and blocks on the free list.
.TP
.I ordblks
The number of ordinary (i.e., non-fastbin) free blocks.
.TP
.I smblks
.\" the glibc info page wrongly says this field is unused
.\" https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=26746
The number of fastbin free blocks (see
.BR mallopt (3)).
.TP
.I hblks
The number of blocks currently allocated using
.BR mmap (2).
(See the discussion of
.B M_MMAP_THRESHOLD
in
.BR mallopt (3).)
.TP
.I hblkhd
The number of bytes in blocks currently allocated using
.BR mmap (2).
.TP
.I usmblks
This field is unused, and is always 0.
.\" It seems to have been zero since at least as far back as glibc 2.15
Historically, it was the "highwater mark" for allocated space\(emthat is,
the maximum amount of space that was ever allocated (in bytes);
this field was maintained only in nonthreading environments.
.TP
.I fsmblks
.\" the glibc info page wrongly says this field is unused
.\" https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=26746
The total number of bytes in fastbin free blocks.
.TP
.I uordblks
The total number of bytes used by in-use allocations.
.TP
.I fordblks
The total number of bytes in free blocks.
.TP
.I keepcost
The total amount of releasable free space at the top
of the heap.
This is the maximum number of bytes that could ideally
(i.e., ignoring page alignment restrictions, and so on) be released by
.BR malloc_trim (3).
.SH VERSIONS
.\" mallinfo(): Available already in glibc 2.0, possibly earlier
The
.BR mallinfo2 ()
function was added
.\" commit e3960d1c57e57f33e0e846d615788f4ede73b945
in glibc 2.33.

would access some global internal objects.
If modify them with non-atomically,
may get inconsistent results.
The identifier
.I mallopt
in
.I const:mallopt
mean that
.BR mallopt ()
would modify the global internal objects with atomics, that make sure
.BR mallinfo ()/
.BR mallinfo2 ()
is safe enough, others modify with non-atomically maybe not.
.SH CONFORMING TO
These functions are not specified by POSIX or the C standards.
A
.BR mallinfo ()
function exists on many System V derivatives,
and was specified in the SVID.
.SH BUGS
.\" FIXME . http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=208
.\" See the 24 Aug 2011 mail by Paul Pluzhnikov:
.\"     "[patch] Fix mallinfo() to accumulate results for all arenas"
.\" on libc-alpha@sourceware.org
.B Information is returned for only the main memory allocation area.
Allocations in other arenas are excluded.
See
.BR malloc_stats (3)
and
.BR malloc_info (3)
for alternatives that include information about other arenas.
.PP
The fields of the
.I mallinfo
structure that is returned by the older
.BR mallinfo ()
function are typed as
.IR int .
However, because some internal bookkeeping values may be of type
.IR long ,
the reported values may wrap around zero and thus be inaccurate.
.SH EXAMPLES
The program below employs
.BR mallinfo2 ()
to retrieve memory allocation statistics before and after
allocating and freeing some blocks of memory.
The statistics are displayed on standard output.
.PP
The first two command-line arguments specify the number and size of
blocks to be allocated with
.BR malloc (3).
.PP
The remaining three arguments specify which of the allocated blocks
should be freed with
.BR free (3).
These three arguments are optional, and specify (in order):
the step size to be used in the loop that frees blocks
(the default is 1, meaning free all blocks in the range);
the ordinal position of the first block to be freed
(default 0, meaning the first allocated block);
and a number one greater than the ordinal position
of the last block to be freed
(default is one greater than the maximum block number).
If these three arguments are omitted,
then the defaults cause all allocated blocks to be freed.
.PP
In the following example run of the program,
1000 allocations of 100 bytes are performed,
and then every second allocated block is freed:
