STRFMON(3)                                      Linux Programmer's Manual                                     STRFMON(3)

NAME
       strfmon, strfmon_l - convert monetary value to a string

SYNOPSIS
       #include <monetary.h>

       ssize_t strfmon(char *s, size_t max, const char *format,
       ...);

       ssize_t strfmon_l(char *s, size_t max, locale_t locale,
       const char *" format , ...);

DESCRIPTION
       The  strfmon() function formats the specified monetary amount according to the current locale and format specifi‐
       cation format and places the result in the character array s of size max.

       The strfmon_l() function performs the same task, but uses the locale specified by locale.  The behavior of  strf‐
       mon_l() is undefined if locale is the special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE (see duplocale(3)) or is not a valid
       locale object handle.

       Ordinary characters in format are copied to s without conversion.  Conversion specifiers are introduced by a  '%'
       character.  Immediately following it there can be zero or more of the following flags:

       =f     The  single-byte  character f is used as the numeric fill character (to be used with a left precision, see
              below).  When not specified, the space character is used.

       ^      Do not use any grouping characters that might be defined for the current locale.  By default, grouping  is
              enabled.

       ( or + The  (  flag indicates that negative amounts should be enclosed between parentheses.  The + flag indicates
              that signs should be handled in the default way, that is, amounts are preceded by the locale's sign  indi‐
              cation, for example, nothing for positive, "-" for negative.

       !      Omit the currency symbol.

       -      Left justify all fields.  The default is right justification.

       Next,  there may be a field width: a decimal digit string specifying a minimum field width in bytes.  The default
       is 0.  A result smaller than this width is padded with spaces (on the left,  unless  the  left-justify  flag  was
       given).

       Next,  there may be a left precision of the form "#" followed by a decimal digit string.  If the number of digits
       left of the radix character is smaller than this, the representation is padded on the left with the numeric  fill
       character.  Grouping characters are not counted in this field width.

       Next,  there  may be a right precision of the form "." followed by a decimal digit string.  The amount being for‐
       matted is rounded to the specified number of digits prior  to  formatting.   The  default  is  specified  in  the
       frac_digits  and int_frac_digits items of the current locale.  If the right precision is 0, no radix character is
       printed.  (The radix character here is determined by LC_MONETARY, and may differ from that  specified  by  LC_NU‐
       MERIC.)

       Finally, the conversion specification must be ended with a conversion character.  The three conversion characters
       are

       %      (In this case, the entire specification must be exactly "%%".)  Put a '%' character in the result string.

       i      One argument of type double is converted using the locale's international currency format.

       n      One argument of type double is converted using the locale's national currency format.

RETURN VALUE
       The strfmon() function returns the number of characters placed in the array s, not including the terminating null
       byte, provided the string, including the terminating null byte, fits.  Otherwise, it sets errno to E2BIG, returns
       -1, and the contents of the array is undefined.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008.

EXAMPLE
       The call

           strfmon(buf, sizeof(buf), "[%^=*#6n] [%=*#6i]",
                   1234.567, 1234.567);

       outputs

           [€ **1234,57] [EUR **1 234,57]

       in the nl_NL locale.  The de_DE, de_CH, en_AU, and en_GB locales yield

           [ **1234,57 €] [ **1.234,57 EUR]
           [ Fr. **1234.57] [ CHF **1'234.57]
           [ $**1234.57] [ AUD**1,234.57]
           [ £**1234.57] [ GBP**1,234.57]
