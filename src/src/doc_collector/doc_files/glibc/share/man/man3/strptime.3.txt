STRPTIME(3)                                     Linux Programmer's Manual                                    STRPTIME(3)

NAME
       strptime - convert a string representation of time to a time tm structure

SYNOPSIS
       #define _XOPEN_SOURCE       /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <time.h>

       char *strptime(const char *restrict s, const char *restrict format,
                      struct tm *restrict tm);

DESCRIPTION
       The  strptime() function is the converse of strftime(3); it converts the character string pointed to by s to val‐
       ues which are stored in the "broken-down time" structure pointed to by tm, using the format specified by format.

       The broken-down time structure tm is defined in <time.h> as follows:

           struct tm {
               int tm_sec;    /* Seconds (0-60) */
               int tm_min;    /* Minutes (0-59) */
               int tm_hour;   /* Hours (0-23) */
               int tm_mday;   /* Day of the month (1-31) */
               int tm_mon;    /* Month (0-11) */
               int tm_year;   /* Year - 1900 */
               int tm_wday;   /* Day of the week (0-6, Sunday = 0) */
               int tm_yday;   /* Day in the year (0-365, 1 Jan = 0) */
               int tm_isdst;  /* Daylight saving time */
           };

       For more details on the tm structure, see ctime(3).

       The format argument is a character string that consists of field descriptors and text characters, reminiscent  of
       scanf(3).   Each  field descriptor consists of a % character followed by another character that specifies the re‐
       placement for the field descriptor.  All other characters in the format string must have a matching character  in
       the  input  string,  except for whitespace, which matches zero or more whitespace characters in the input string.
       There should be whitespace or other alphanumeric characters between any two field descriptors.

       The strptime() function processes the input string from left to right.  Each of the three possible input elements
       (whitespace,  literal,  or format) are handled one after the other.  If the input cannot be matched to the format
       string, the function stops.  The remainder of the format and input strings are not processed.

       The supported input field descriptors are listed below.  In case a text string (such as the name of a day of  the
       week  or  a month name) is to be matched, the comparison is case insensitive.  In case a number is to be matched,
       leading zeros are permitted but not required.

       %%     The % character.

       %a or %A
              The name of the day of the week according to the current locale, in abbreviated form or the full name.

       %b or %B or %h
              The month name according to the current locale, in abbreviated form or the full name.

       %c     The date and time representation for the current locale.

       %C     The century number (0–99).

       %d or %e
              The day of month (1–31).

       %D     Equivalent to %m/%d/%y.  (This is the American style date, very  confusing  to  non-Americans,  especially
              since %d/%m/%y is widely used in Europe.  The ISO 8601 standard format is %Y-%m-%d.)

       %H     The hour (0–23).

       %I     The hour on a 12-hour clock (1–12).

       %j     The day number in the year (1–366).

       %m     The month number (1–12).

       %M     The minute (0–59).

       %n     Arbitrary whitespace.

       %p     The locale's equivalent of AM or PM.  (Note: there may be none.)

       %r     The  12-hour clock time (using the locale's AM or PM).  In the POSIX locale equivalent to %I:%M:%S %p.  If
              t_fmt_ampm is empty in the LC_TIME part of the current locale, then the behavior is undefined.

       %R     Equivalent to %H:%M.

       %S     The second (0–60; 60 may occur for leap seconds; earlier also 61 was allowed).

       %t     Arbitrary whitespace.

       %T     Equivalent to %H:%M:%S.

       %U     The week number with Sunday the first day of the week (0–53).  The first Sunday of January  is  the  first
              day of week 1.

       %w     The ordinal number of the day of the week (0–6), with Sunday = 0.

       %W     The  week  number  with Monday the first day of the week (0–53).  The first Monday of January is the first
              day of week 1.

       %x     The date, using the locale's date format.

       %X     The time, using the locale's time format.

       %y     The year within century (0–99).  When a century is not otherwise specified, values in the range 69–99  re‐
              fer to years in the twentieth century (1969–1999); values in the range 00–68 refer to years in the twenty-
              first century (2000–2068).

       %Y     The year, including century (for example, 1991).

       Some field descriptors can be modified by the E or O modifier characters to indicate that an  alternative  format
       or  specification  should  be used.  If the alternative format or specification does not exist in the current lo‐
       cale, the unmodified field descriptor is used.

       The E modifier specifies that the input string may contain alternative locale-dependent versions of the date  and
       time representation:

       %Ec    The locale's alternative date and time representation.

       %EC    The name of the base year (period) in the locale's alternative representation.

       %Ex    The locale's alternative date representation.

       %EX    The locale's alternative time representation.

       %Ey    The offset from %EC (year only) in the locale's alternative representation.

       %EY    The full alternative year representation.

       The O modifier specifies that the numerical input may be in an alternative locale-dependent format:

       %Od or %Oe
              The  day  of the month using the locale's alternative numeric symbols; leading zeros are permitted but not
              required.

       %OH    The hour (24-hour clock) using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

       %OI    The hour (12-hour clock) using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

       %Om    The month using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

       %OM    The minutes using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

       %OS    The seconds using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

       %OU    The week number of the year (Sunday as the first day of the week) using the locale's  alternative  numeric
              symbols.

       %Ow    The ordinal number of the day of the week (Sunday=0),
               using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

       %OW    The  week  number of the year (Monday as the first day of the week) using the locale's alternative numeric
              symbols.

       %Oy    The year (offset from %C) using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

RETURN VALUE
       The return value of the function is a pointer to the first character not processed in  this  function  call.   In
       case  the input string contains more characters than required by the format string, the return value points right
       after the last consumed input character.  In case the whole input string is consumed, the return value points  to
       the  null  byte at the end of the string.  If strptime() fails to match all of the format string and therefore an
       error occurred, the function returns NULL.

NOTES
       In principle, this function does not initialize tm but stores only the values  specified.   This  means  that  tm
       should be initialized before the call.  Details differ a bit between different UNIX systems.  The glibc implemen‐
       tation does not touch those fields which are not explicitly specified, except that it recomputes the tm_wday  and
       tm_yday field if any of the year, month, or day elements changed.

       The  'y'  (year  in century) specification is taken to specify a year in the range 1950–2049 by glibc 2.0.  It is
       taken to be a year in 1969–2068 since glibc 2.1.

   Glibc notes
       For reasons of symmetry, glibc tries to support for strptime() the same format  characters  as  for  strftime(3).
       (In most cases, the corresponding fields are parsed, but no field in tm is changed.)  This leads to

       %F     Equivalent to %Y-%m-%d, the ISO 8601 date format.

       %g     The year corresponding to the ISO week number, but without the century (0–99).

       %G     The year corresponding to the ISO week number.  (For example, 1991.)

       %u     The day of the week as a decimal number (1–7, where Monday = 1).

       %V     The  ISO  8601:1988 week number as a decimal number (1–53).  If the week (starting on Monday) containing 1
              January has four or more days in the new year, then it is considered week 1.  Otherwise, it  is  the  last
              week of the previous year, and the next week is week 1.

       %z     An RFC-822/ISO 8601 standard timezone specification.

       %Z     The timezone name.

       Similarly, because of GNU extensions to strftime(3), %k is accepted as a synonym for %H, and %l should be accept‐
       ed as a synonym for %I, and %P is accepted as a synonym for %p.  Finally

       %s     The number of seconds since the Epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC).  Leap seconds are not counted  un‐
              less leap second support is available.

       The glibc implementation does not require whitespace between two field descriptors.

EXAMPLES
       The following example demonstrates the use of strptime() and strftime(3).

       #define _XOPEN_SOURCE
       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <stdlib.h>
       #include <string.h>
       #include <time.h>

       int
       main(void)
       {
           struct tm tm;
           char buf[255];

           memset(&tm, 0, sizeof(tm));
           strptime("2001-11-12 18:31:01", "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", &tm);
           strftime(buf, sizeof(buf), "%d %b %Y %H:%M", &tm);
           puts(buf);
           exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
       }
