SETBUF(3)                                       Linux Programmer's Manual                                      SETBUF(3)

NAME
       setbuf, setbuffer, setlinebuf, setvbuf - stream buffering operations

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>

       void setbuf(FILE *stream, char *buf);

       void setbuffer(FILE *stream, char *buf, size_t size);

       void setlinebuf(FILE *stream);

       int setvbuf(FILE *stream, char *buf, int mode, size_t size);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       setbuffer(), setlinebuf():
           Since glibc 2.19:
               _DEFAULT_SOURCE
           Glibc 2.19 and earlier:
               _BSD_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  three types of buffering available are unbuffered, block buffered, and line buffered.  When an output stream
       is unbuffered, information appears on the destination file or terminal as soon  as  written;  when  it  is  block
       buffered  many  characters  are saved up and written as a block; when it is line buffered characters are saved up
       until a newline is output or input is read from any stream attached to a terminal device (typically stdin).   The
       function fflush(3) may be used to force the block out early.  (See fclose(3).)

       Normally  all  files  are block buffered.  If a stream refers to a terminal (as stdout normally does), it is line
       buffered.  The standard error stream stderr is always unbuffered by default.

       The setvbuf() function may be used on any open stream to change its buffer.  The mode argument must be one of the
       following three macros:

              _IONBF unbuffered

              _IOLBF line buffered

              _IOFBF fully buffered

       Except for unbuffered files, the buf argument should point to a buffer at least size bytes long; this buffer will
       be used instead of the current buffer.  If the argument buf is NULL, only the mode is affected; a new buffer will
       be allocated on the next read or write operation.  The setvbuf() function may be used only after opening a stream
       and before any other operations have been performed on it.

       The other three calls are, in effect, simply aliases for calls to setvbuf().  The setbuf()  function  is  exactly
       equivalent to the call

           setvbuf(stream, buf, buf ? _IOFBF : _IONBF, BUFSIZ);

       The  setbuffer()  function is the same, except that the size of the buffer is up to the caller, rather than being
       determined by the default BUFSIZ.  The setlinebuf() function is exactly equivalent to the call:

           setvbuf(stream, NULL, _IOLBF, 0);

RETURN VALUE
       The function setvbuf() returns 0 on success.  It returns nonzero on failure (mode is invalid or the request  can‐
       not be honored).  It may set errno on failure.

       The other functions do not return a value.

CONFORMING TO
       The setbuf() and setvbuf() functions conform to C89 and C99.

BUGS
       You  must  make sure that the space that buf points to still exists by the time stream is closed, which also hap‐
       pens at program termination.  For example, the following is invalid:

       #include <stdio.h>

       int
       main(void)
       {
           char buf[BUFSIZ];
           setbuf(stdin, buf);
           printf("Hello, world!\n");
           return 0;
       }
