ISWALNUM(3)                                     Linux Programmer's Manual                                    ISWALNUM(3)

NAME
       iswalnum - test for alphanumeric wide character

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       int iswalnum(wint_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       The  iswalnum()  function  is the wide-character equivalent of the isalnum(3) function.  It tests whether wc is a
       wide character belonging to the wide-character class "alnum".

       The wide-character class "alnum" is a subclass of the wide-character class "graph", and therefore also a subclass
       of the wide-character class "print".

       Being a subclass of the wide-character class "print", the wide-character class "alnum" is disjoint from the wide-
       character class "cntrl".

       Being a subclass of the wide-character class "graph", the wide-character class "alnum" is disjoint from the wide-
       character class "space" and its subclass "blank".

       The wide-character class "alnum" is disjoint from the wide-character class "punct".

       The  wide-character  class  "alnum"  is the union of the wide-character classes "alpha" and "digit".  As such, it
       also contains the wide-character class "xdigit".

       The wide-character class "alnum" always contains at least the letters 'A' to 'Z', 'a' to 'z' and the  digits  '0'
       to '9'.

RETURN VALUE
       The  iswalnum() function returns nonzero if wc is a wide character belonging to the wide-character class "alnum".
       Otherwise, it returns zero.

CONFORMING TO

NOTES
       The behavior of iswalnum() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the current locale.
