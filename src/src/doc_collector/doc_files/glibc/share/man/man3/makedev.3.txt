MAKEDEV(3)                                      Linux Programmer's Manual                                     MAKEDEV(3)

NAME
       makedev, major, minor - manage a device number

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/sysmacros.h>

       dev_t makedev(unsigned int maj, unsigned int min);

       unsigned int major(dev_t dev);
       unsigned int minor(dev_t dev);

DESCRIPTION
       A device ID consists of two parts: a major ID, identifying the class of the device, and a minor ID, identifying a
       specific instance of a device in that class.  A device ID is represented using the type dev_t.

       Given major and minor device IDs, makedev() combines these to produce a device ID, returned as the  function  re‐
       sult.  This device ID can be given to mknod(2), for example.

       The  major()  and  minor() functions perform the converse task: given a device ID, they return, respectively, the
       major and minor components.  These macros can be useful to, for example, decompose the device IDs in  the  struc‐
       ture returned by stat(2).

CONFORMING TO
       The  makedev(),  major(),  and minor() functions are not specified in POSIX.1, but are present on many other sys‐
       tems.

NOTES
       These interfaces are defined as macros.  Since glibc 2.3.3, they have been aliases for three  GNU-specific  func‐
       tions:  gnu_dev_makedev(),  gnu_dev_major(),  and gnu_dev_minor().  The latter names are exported, but the tradi‐
       tional names are more portable.

       The BSDs expose the definitions for these macros via <sys/types.h>.  Depending on the version, glibc also exposes
       definitions  for  these  macros from that header file if suitable feature test macros are defined.  However, this
       behavior was deprecated in glibc 2.25, and since glibc 2.28, <sys/types.h> no longer provides these definitions.
