WCSTOMBS(3)                                     Linux Programmer's Manual                                    WCSTOMBS(3)

NAME
       wcstombs - convert a wide-character string to a multibyte string

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       size_t wcstombs(char *restrict dest, const wchar_t *restrict src,
                       size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       If  dest is not NULL, the wcstombs() function converts the wide-character string src to a multibyte string start‐
       ing at dest.  At most n bytes are written to dest.  The sequence of characters placed in dest begins in the  ini‐
       tial shift state.  The conversion can stop for three reasons:

       1. A  wide  character  has been encountered that can not be represented as a multibyte sequence (according to the
          current locale).  In this case, (size_t) -1 is returned.

       2. The length limit forces a stop.  In this case, the number of bytes written to dest is returned, but the  shift
          state at this point is lost.

       3. The  wide-character  string  has  been  completely  converted,  including  the terminating null wide character
          (L'\0').  In this case, the conversion ends in the initial shift state.  The number of bytes written to  dest,
          excluding the terminating null byte ('\0'), is returned.

       The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least n bytes at dest.

       If  dest  is  NULL,  n  is ignored, and the conversion proceeds as above, except that the converted bytes are not
       written out to memory, and no length limit exists.

       In order to avoid the case 2 above, the  programmer  should  make  sure  n  is  greater  than  or  equal  to  wc‐
       stombs(NULL,src,0)+1.

RETURN VALUE
       The  wcstombs() function returns the number of bytes that make up the converted part of a multibyte sequence, not
       including the terminating null byte.  If  a  wide  character  was  encountered  which  could  not  be  converted,
       (size_t) -1 is returned.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, C99.

NOTES
       The behavior of wcstombs() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the current locale.

       The function wcsrtombs(3) provides a better interface to the same functionality.
