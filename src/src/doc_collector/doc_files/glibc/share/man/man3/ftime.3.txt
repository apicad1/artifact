FTIME(3)                                        Linux Programmer's Manual                                       FTIME(3)

NAME
       ftime - return date and time

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/timeb.h>

       int ftime(struct timeb *tp);

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE: This function is no longer provided by the GNU C library.  Use clock_gettime(2) instead.

       This  function  returns  the  current time as seconds and milliseconds since the Epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000
       (UTC).  The time is returned in tp, which is declared as follows:

           struct timeb {
               time_t         time;
               unsigned short millitm;
               short          timezone;
               short          dstflag;
           };

       Here time is the number of seconds since the Epoch, and millitm is the number of milliseconds since time  seconds
       since  the Epoch.  The timezone field is the local timezone measured in minutes of time west of Greenwich (with a
       negative value indicating minutes east of Greenwich).  The dstflag field is a flag that,  if  nonzero,  indicates
       that Daylight Saving time applies locally during the appropriate part of the year.

       POSIX.1-2001 says that the contents of the timezone and dstflag fields are unspecified; avoid relying on them.

RETURN VALUE
       This function always returns 0.  (POSIX.1-2001 specifies, and some systems document, a -1 error return.)

VERSIONS
       Starting  with  glibc  2.33, the ftime() function and the <sys/timeb.h> header have been removed.  To support old
       binaries, glibc continues to provide a compatibility symbol for applications linked against glibc 2.32  and  ear‐
       lier.

CONFORMING TO
       4.2BSD, POSIX.1-2001.  POSIX.1-2008 removes the specification of ftime().

       This  function is obsolete.  Don't use it.  If the time in seconds suffices, time(2) can be used; gettimeofday(2)
       gives microseconds; clock_gettime(2) gives nanoseconds but is not as widely available.

BUGS
       Early glibc2 is buggy and returns 0 in the millitm field; glibc 2.1.1 is correct again.
