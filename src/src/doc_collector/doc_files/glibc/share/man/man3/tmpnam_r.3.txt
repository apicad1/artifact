TMPNAM(3)                                       Linux Programmer's Manual                                      TMPNAM(3)

NAME
       tmpnam, tmpnam_r - create a name for a temporary file

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>

       char *tmpnam(char *s);
       char *tmpnam_r(char *s);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       tmpnam_r()
           Since glibc 2.19:
               _DEFAULT_SOURCE
           Up to and including glibc 2.19:
               _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       Note: avoid using these functions; use mkstemp(3) or tmpfile(3) instead.

       The tmpnam() function returns a pointer to a string that is a valid filename, and such that a file with this name
       did not exist at some point in time, so that naive programmers may think it a suitable name for a temporary file.
       If the argument s is NULL, this name is generated in an internal static buffer and may be overwritten by the next
       call to tmpnam().  If s is not NULL, the name is copied to the character array  (of  length  at  least  L_tmpnam)
       pointed to by s and the value s is returned in case of success.

       The created pathname has a directory prefix P_tmpdir.  (Both L_tmpnam and P_tmpdir are defined in <stdio.h>, just
       like the TMP_MAX mentioned below.)

       The tmpnam_r() function performs the same task as tmpnam(), but returns NULL (to indicate an error) if s is NULL.

RETURN VALUE
       These functions return a pointer to a unique temporary filename, or NULL if a unique name cannot be generated.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.

CONFORMING TO
       tmpnam(): SVr4, 4.3BSD, C89, C99, POSIX.1-2001.  POSIX.1-2008 marks tmpnam() as obsolete.

       tmpnam_r() is a nonstandard extension that is also available on a few other systems.

NOTES
       The tmpnam() function generates a different string each time it is called, up to TMP_MAX times.  If it is  called
       more than TMP_MAX times, the behavior is implementation defined.

       Although these functions generate names that are difficult to guess, it is nevertheless possible that between the
       time that the pathname is returned and the time that the program opens it,  another  program  might  create  that
       pathname  using open(2), or create it as a symbolic link.  This can lead to security holes.  To avoid such possi‐
       bilities, use the open(2) O_EXCL flag to open the pathname.  Or better yet, use mkstemp(3) or tmpfile(3).

       Portable applications that use threads cannot call tmpnam() with a NULL  argument  if  either  _POSIX_THREADS  or
       _POSIX_THREAD_SAFE_FUNCTIONS is defined.

BUGS
       Never use these functions.  Use mkstemp(3) or tmpfile(3) instead.
