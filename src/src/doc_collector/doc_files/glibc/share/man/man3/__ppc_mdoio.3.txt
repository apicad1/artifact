NAME
       __ppc_yield, __ppc_mdoio, __ppc_mdoom - Hint the processor to release shared resources

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/platform/ppc.h>

       void __ppc_yield(void);
       void __ppc_mdoio(void);
       void __ppc_mdoom(void);

DESCRIPTION
       These functions provide hints about the usage of resources that are shared with other processors on the Power ar‐
       chitecture.  They can be used, for example, if a program waiting on a lock intends to divert the shared resources
       to be used by other processors.

       __ppc_yield() provides a hint that performance will probably be improved if shared resources dedicated to the ex‐
       ecuting processor are released for use by other processors.

       __ppc_mdoio() provides a hint that performance will probably be improved if shared resources dedicated to the ex‐
       ecuting processor are released until all outstanding storage accesses to caching-inhibited storage have been com‐
       pleted.

       __ppc_mdoom() provides a hint that performance will probably be improved if shared resources dedicated to the ex‐
       ecuting  processor are released until all outstanding storage accesses to cacheable storage for which the data is
       not in the cache have been completed.

VERSIONS
       These functions first appeared in glibc in version 2.18.
