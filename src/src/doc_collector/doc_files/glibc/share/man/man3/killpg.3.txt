KILLPG(3)                                       Linux Programmer's Manual                                      KILLPG(3)

NAME
       killpg - send signal to a process group

SYNOPSIS
       #include <signal.h>

       int killpg(int pgrp, int sig);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       killpg():
           _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500
               || /* Since glibc 2.19: */ _DEFAULT_SOURCE
               || /* Glibc <= 2.19: */ _BSD_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       killpg() sends the signal sig to the process group pgrp.  See signal(7) for a list of signals.

       If  pgrp  is  0,  killpg() sends the signal to the calling process's process group.  (POSIX says: if pgrp is less
       than or equal to 1, the behavior is undefined.)

       For the permissions required to send a signal to another process, see kill(2).

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EINVAL sig is not a valid signal number.

       EPERM  The process does not have permission to send the signal to any of the target processes.  For the  required
              permissions, see kill(2).

       ESRCH  No process can be found in the process group specified by pgrp.

       ESRCH  The process group was given as 0 but the sending process does not have a process group.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, SVr4, 4.4BSD (killpg() first appeared in 4BSD).

NOTES
       There are various differences between the permission checking in BSD-type systems and System V-type systems.  See
       the POSIX rationale for kill(3p).  A difference not mentioned by POSIX concerns the return value EPERM: BSD docu‐
       ments that no signal is sent and EPERM returned when the permission check failed for at least one target process,
       while POSIX documents EPERM only when the permission check failed for all target processes.

   C library/kernel differences
       On Linux, killpg() is implemented as a library function that makes the call kill(-pgrp, sig).
