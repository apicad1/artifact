ISWALPHA(3)                                     Linux Programmer's Manual                                    ISWALPHA(3)

NAME
       iswalpha - test for alphabetic wide character

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       int iswalpha(wint_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       The  iswalpha()  function  is the wide-character equivalent of the isalpha(3) function.  It tests whether wc is a
       wide character belonging to the wide-character class "alpha".

       The wide-character class "alpha" is a subclass of the wide-character class "alnum", and therefore also a subclass
       of the wide-character class "graph" and of the wide-character class "print".

       Being a subclass of the wide-character class "print", the wide-character class "alpha" is disjoint from the wide-
       character class "cntrl".

       Being a subclass of the wide-character class "graph", the wide-character class "alpha" is disjoint from the wide-
       character class "space" and its subclass "blank".

       Being a subclass of the wide-character class "alnum", the wide-character class "alpha" is disjoint from the wide-
       character class "punct".

       The wide-character class "alpha" is disjoint from the wide-character class "digit".

       The wide-character class "alpha" contains the wide-character classes "upper" and "lower".

       The wide-character class "alpha" always contains at least the letters 'A' to 'Z' and 'a' to 'z'.

RETURN VALUE
       The iswalpha() function returns nonzero if wc is a wide character belonging to the wide-character class  "alpha".
       Otherwise, it returns zero.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, C99.

NOTES
       The behavior of iswalpha() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the current locale.
