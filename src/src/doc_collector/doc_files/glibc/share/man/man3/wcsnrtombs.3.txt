WCSNRTOMBS(3)                                   Linux Programmer's Manual                                  WCSNRTOMBS(3)

NAME
       wcsnrtombs - convert a wide-character string to a multibyte string

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       size_t wcsnrtombs(char *restrict dest, const wchar_t **restrict src,
                         size_t nwc, size_t len, mbstate_t *restrict ps);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       wcsnrtombs():
           Since glibc 2.10:
               _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L
           Before glibc 2.10:
               _GNU_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The wcsnrtombs() function is like the wcsrtombs(3) function, except that the number of wide characters to be con‐
       verted, starting at *src, is limited to nwc.

       If dest is not NULL, the wcsnrtombs() function converts at most  nwc  wide  characters  from  the  wide-character
       string  *src to a multibyte string starting at dest.  At most len bytes are written to dest.  The shift state *ps
       is updated.  The conversion is effectively performed by repeatedly calling wcrtomb(dest, *src, ps),  as  long  as
       this  call  succeeds,  and then incrementing dest by the number of bytes written and *src by one.  The conversion
       can stop for three reasons:

       1. A wide character has been encountered that can not be represented as a multibyte sequence  (according  to  the
          current  locale).  In this case, *src is left pointing to the invalid wide character, (size_t) -1 is returned,
          and errno is set to EILSEQ.

       2. nwc wide characters have been converted without encountering a null wide  character  (L'\0'),  or  the  length
          limit  forces a stop.  In this case, *src is left pointing to the next wide character to be converted, and the
          number of bytes written to dest is returned.

       3. The wide-character string has been completely converted, including the terminating null wide character  (which
          has  the  side  effect of bringing back *ps to the initial state).  In this case, *src is set to NULL, and the
          number of bytes written to dest, excluding the terminating null byte ('\0'), is returned.

       If dest is NULL, len is ignored, and the conversion proceeds as above, except that the converted  bytes  are  not
       written out to memory, and that no destination length limit exists.

       In  both  of  the above cases, if ps is NULL, a static anonymous state known only to the wcsnrtombs() function is
       used instead.

       The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least len bytes at dest.

RETURN VALUE
       The wcsnrtombs() function returns the number of bytes that make up the converted part of multibyte sequence,  not
       including  the  terminating  null  byte.   If  a  wide  character  was  encountered which could not be converted,
       (size_t) -1 is returned, and errno set to EILSEQ.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2008.

NOTES
       The behavior of wcsnrtombs() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the current locale.

       Passing NULL as ps is not multithread safe.
