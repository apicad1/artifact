NAME
       ccosh, ccoshf, ccoshl - complex hyperbolic cosine

SYNOPSIS
       #include <complex.h>

       double complex ccosh(double complex z);
       float complex ccoshf(float complex z);
       long double complex ccoshl(long double complex z);

       Link with -lm.

DESCRIPTION
       These functions calculate the complex hyperbolic cosine of z.

       The complex hyperbolic cosine function is defined as:

           ccosh(z) = (exp(z)+exp(-z))/2

VERSIONS
       These functions first appeared in glibc in version 2.1.

CONFORMING TO
       C99, POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008.
