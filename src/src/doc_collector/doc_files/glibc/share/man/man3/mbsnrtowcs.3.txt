NAME
       mbsnrtowcs - convert a multibyte string to a wide-character string

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       size_t mbsnrtowcs(wchar_t *restrict dest, const char **restrict src,
                         size_t nms, size_t len, mbstate_t *restrict ps);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       mbsnrtowcs():
           Since glibc 2.10:
               _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L
           Before glibc 2.10:
               _GNU_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  mbsnrtowcs()  function  is  like the mbsrtowcs(3) function, except that the number of bytes to be converted,
       starting at *src, is limited to at most nms bytes.

       If dest is not NULL, the mbsnrtowcs() function converts at most nms bytes from the multibyte  string  *src  to  a
       wide-character string starting at dest.  At most len wide characters are written to dest.  The shift state *ps is
       updated.  The conversion is effectively performed by repeatedly calling mbrtowc(dest, *src, n,  ps)  where  n  is
       some  positive number, as long as this call succeeds, and then incrementing dest by one and *src by the number of
       bytes consumed.  The conversion can stop for three reasons:

       1. An invalid multibyte sequence has been encountered.  In this case, *src is left pointing to the invalid multi‐
          byte sequence, (size_t) -1 is returned, and errno is set to EILSEQ.

       2. The nms limit forces a stop, or len non-L'\0' wide characters have been stored at dest.  In this case, *src is
          left pointing to the next multibyte sequence to be converted, and the number of  wide  characters  written  to
          dest is returned.

       3. The  multibyte  string  has  been  completely  converted, including the terminating null wide character ('\0')
          (which has the side effect of bringing back *ps to the initial state).  In this case, *src is set to NULL, and
          the number of wide characters written to dest, excluding the terminating null wide character, is returned.

       According to POSIX.1, if the input buffer ends with an incomplete character, it is unspecified whether conversion
       stops at the end of the previous character (if any), or at the end of the input buffer.  The glibc implementation
       adopts the former behavior.

       If  dest is NULL, len is ignored, and the conversion proceeds as above, except that the converted wide characters
       are not written out to memory, and that no destination length limit exists.

       In both of the above cases, if ps is NULL, a static anonymous state known only to the  mbsnrtowcs()  function  is
       used instead.

       The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least len wide characters at dest.

RETURN VALUE
       The mbsnrtowcs() function returns the number of wide characters that make up the converted part of the wide-char‐
       acter string, not including the terminating null wide character.  If an invalid multibyte  sequence  was  encoun‐
       tered, (size_t) -1 is returned, and errno set to EILSEQ.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2008.

NOTES
       The behavior of mbsnrtowcs() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the current locale.

       Passing NULL as ps is not multithread safe.
