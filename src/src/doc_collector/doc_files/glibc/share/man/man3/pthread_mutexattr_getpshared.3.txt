PTHREAD_MUTEXATTR_GETPSHARED(3)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                PTHREAD_MUTEXATTR_GETPSHARED(3)

NAME
       pthread_mutexattr_getpshared, pthread_mutexattr_setpshared - get/set process-shared mutex attribute

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_mutexattr_getpshared(
                             const pthread_mutexattr_t *restrict attr,
                             int *restrict pshared);
       int pthread_mutexattr_setpshared(pthread_mutexattr_t *attr,
                             int pshared);

       Compile and link with -pthread.

DESCRIPTION
       These  functions  get  and set the process-shared attribute in a mutex attributes object.  This attribute must be
       appropriately set to ensure correct, efficient operation of a mutex created using this attributes object.

       The process-shared attribute can have one of the following values:

       PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE
              Mutexes created with this attributes object are to be shared only among threads in the same  process  that
              initialized the mutex.  This is the default value for the process-shared mutex attribute.

       PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED
              Mutexes created with this attributes object can be shared between any threads that have access to the mem‐
              ory containing the object, including threads in different processes.

       pthread_mutexattr_getpshared() places the value of the process-shared attribute of the  mutex  attributes  object
       referred to by attr in the location pointed to by pshared.

       pthread_mutexattr_setpshared()  sets the value of the process-shared attribute of the mutex attributes object re‐
       ferred to by attr to the value specified in pshared.

       If attr does not refer to an initialized mutex attributes object, the behavior is undefined.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return 0.  On error, they return a positive error number.

ERRORS
       pthread_mutexattr_setpshared() can fail with the following errors:

       EINVAL The value specified in pshared is invalid.

       ENOTSUP
              pshared is PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED but the implementation does not support process-shared mutexes.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008.
