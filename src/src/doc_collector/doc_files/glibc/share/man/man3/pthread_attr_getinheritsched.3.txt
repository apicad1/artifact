PTHREAD_ATTR_SETINHERITSCHED(3)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                PTHREAD_ATTR_SETINHERITSCHED(3)

NAME
       pthread_attr_setinheritsched,  pthread_attr_getinheritsched  -  set/get inherit-scheduler attribute in thread at‐
       tributes object

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_attr_setinheritsched(pthread_attr_t *attr,
                                        int inheritsched);
       int pthread_attr_getinheritsched(const pthread_attr_t *attr,
                                        int *inheritsched);

       Compile and link with -pthread.

DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_attr_setinheritsched() function sets the inherit-scheduler attribute of the thread attributes  object
       referred to by attr to the value specified in inheritsched.  The inherit-scheduler attribute determines whether a
       thread created using the thread attributes object attr will inherit its scheduling attributes  from  the  calling
       thread or whether it will take them from attr.

       The  following  scheduling  attributes  are  affected  by  the  inherit-scheduler  attribute:  scheduling  policy
       (pthread_attr_setschedpolicy(3)),  scheduling  priority  (pthread_attr_setschedparam(3)),  and  contention  scope
       (pthread_attr_setscope(3)).

       The following values may be specified in inheritsched:

       PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED
              Threads that are created using attr inherit scheduling attributes from the creating thread; the scheduling
              attributes in attr are ignored.

       PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED
              Threads that are created using attr take their scheduling attributes from the values specified by the  at‐
              tributes object.

       The  default  setting  of  the  inherit-scheduler  attribute  in  a newly initialized thread attributes object is
       PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED.

       The pthread_attr_getinheritsched() returns the inherit-scheduler attribute of the thread attributes  object  attr
       in the buffer pointed to by inheritsched.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return 0; on error, they return a nonzero error number.

ERRORS
       pthread_attr_setinheritsched() can fail with the following error:

       EINVAL Invalid value in inheritsched.

       POSIX.1  also  documents  an  optional  ENOTSUP  error  ("attempt was made to set the attribute to an unsupported
       value") for pthread_attr_setinheritsched().

BUGS
       As  at  glibc  2.8,  if a thread attributes object is initialized using pthread_attr_init(3), then the scheduling
       policy of the attributes object is set to SCHED_OTHER and the scheduling priority is set to 0.  However,  if  the
       inherit-scheduler  attribute is then set to PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED, then a thread created using the attribute ob‐
       ject wrongly inherits its scheduling attributes from the creating thread.  This bug does not occur if either  the
       scheduling policy or scheduling priority attribute is explicitly set in the thread attributes object before call‐
       ing pthread_create(3).

EXAMPLE
       See pthread_setschedparam(3).
