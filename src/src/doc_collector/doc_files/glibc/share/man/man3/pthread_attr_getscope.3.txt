PTHREAD_ATTR_SETSCOPE(3)                        Linux Programmer's Manual                       PTHREAD_ATTR_SETSCOPE(3)

NAME
       pthread_attr_setscope, pthread_attr_getscope - set/get contention scope attribute in thread attributes object

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_attr_setscope(pthread_attr_t *attr, int scope);
       int pthread_attr_getscope(const pthread_attr_t *attr, int *scope);

       Compile and link with -pthread.

DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_attr_setscope() function sets the contention scope attribute of the thread attributes object referred
       to by attr to the value specified in scope.  The contention scope attribute defines the set  of  threads  against
       which a thread competes for resources such as the CPU.  POSIX.1 specifies two possible values for scope:

       PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM
              The  thread  competes  for resources with all other threads in all processes on the system that are in the
              same scheduling allocation domain (a group of one or more processors).  PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM  threads  are
              scheduled relative to one another according to their scheduling policy and priority.

       PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS
              The  thread  competes for resources with all other threads in the same process that were also created with
              the PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS contention scope.  PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS threads are scheduled relative to other
              threads  in  the process according to their scheduling policy and priority.  POSIX.1 leaves it unspecified
              how these threads contend with other threads in other process on the system or with other threads  in  the
              same process that were created with the PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM contention scope.

       POSIX.1  requires  that  an  implementation  support  at  least  one  of these contention scopes.  Linux supports
       PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM, but not PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS.

       On systems that  support  multiple  contention  scopes,  then,  in  order  for  the  parameter  setting  made  by
       pthread_attr_setscope() to have effect when calling pthread_create(3), the caller must use pthread_attr_setinher‐
       itsched(3) to set the inherit-scheduler attribute of the attributes object attr to PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED.

       The pthread_attr_getscope() function returns the contention scope attribute of the thread attributes  object  re‐
       ferred to by attr in the buffer pointed to by scope.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return 0; on error, they return a nonzero error number.

ERRORS
       pthread_attr_setscope() can fail with the following errors:

       EINVAL An invalid value was specified in scope.

       ENOTSUP
              scope specified the value PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS, which is not supported on Linux.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008.

NOTES
       The PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM contention scope typically indicates that a user-space thread is  bound  directly  to  a
       single  kernel-scheduling entity.  This is the case on Linux for the obsolete LinuxThreads implementation and the
       modern NPTL implementation, which are both 1:1 threading implementations.

       POSIX.1 specifies that the default contention scope is implementation-defined.
