LSEARCH(3)                                      Linux Programmer's Manual                                     LSEARCH(3)

NAME
       lfind, lsearch - linear search of an array

SYNOPSIS
       #include <search.h>

       void *lfind(const void *key, const void *base, size_t *nmemb,
                size_t size, int(*compar)(const void *, const void *));

       void *lsearch(const void *key, void *base, size_t *nmemb,
                size_t size, int(*compar)(const void *, const void *));

DESCRIPTION
       lfind()  and  lsearch() perform a linear search for key in the array base which has *nmemb elements of size bytes
       each.  The comparison function referenced by compar is expected to have two arguments which point to the key  ob‐
       ject  and  to  an array member, in that order, and which returns zero if the key object matches the array member,
       and nonzero otherwise.

       If lsearch() does not find a matching element, then the key object is inserted at  the  end  of  the  table,  and
       *nmemb  is  incremented.   In  particular,  one  should know that a matching element exists, or that more room is
       available.

RETURN VALUE
       lfind() returns a pointer to a matching member of the array, or NULL if no match is found.  lsearch()  returns  a
       pointer to a matching member of the array, or to the newly added member if no match is found.
