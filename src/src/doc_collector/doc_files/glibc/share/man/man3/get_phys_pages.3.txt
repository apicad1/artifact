GET_PHYS_PAGES(3)                               Linux Programmer's Manual                              GET_PHYS_PAGES(3)

NAME
       get_phys_pages, get_avphys_pages - get total and available physical page counts

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/sysinfo.h>

       long get_phys_pages(void);
       long get_avphys_pages(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The function get_phys_pages() returns the total number of physical pages of memory available on the system.

       The function get_avphys_pages() returns the number of currently available physical pages of memory on the system.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  these functions return a nonnegative value as given in DESCRIPTION.  On failure, they return -1 and
       set errno to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       ENOSYS The system could not provide the required information (possibly  because  the  /proc  filesystem  was  not
              mounted).

CONFORMING TO
       These functions are GNU extensions.

NOTES
       Before  glibc 2.23, these functions obtained the required information by scanning the MemTotal and MemFree fields
       of /proc/meminfo.  Since glibc 2.23, these functions obtain the required information by calling sysinfo(2).

       The following sysconf(3) calls provide a portable means of obtaining the same information as  the  functions  de‚Äê
       scribed on this page.

           total_pages = sysconf(_SC_PHYS_PAGES);    /* total pages */
           avl_pages = sysconf(_SC_AVPHYS_PAGES);    /* available pages */

EXAMPLES
       The following example shows how get_phys_pages() and get_avphys_pages() can be used.

       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <stdlib.h>
       #include <sys/sysinfo.h>

       int
       main(int argc, char *argv[])
       {
           printf("This system has %ld pages of physical memory and "
                   "%ld pages of physical memory available.\n",
                   get_phys_pages(), get_avphys_pages());
           exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
       }
