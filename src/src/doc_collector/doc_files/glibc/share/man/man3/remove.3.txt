REMOVE(3)                                       Linux Programmer's Manual                                      REMOVE(3)

NAME
       remove - remove a file or directory

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>

       int remove(const char *pathname);

DESCRIPTION
       remove() deletes a name from the filesystem.  It calls unlink(2) for files, and rmdir(2) for directories.

       If  the removed name was the last link to a file and no processes have the file open, the file is deleted and the
       space it was using is made available for reuse.

       If the name was the last link to a file, but any processes still have the file open, the file will remain in  ex‐
       istence until the last file descriptor referring to it is closed.

       If the name referred to a symbolic link, the link is removed.

       If  the name referred to a socket, FIFO, or device, the name is removed, but processes which have the object open
       may continue to use it.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The errors that occur are those for unlink(2) and rmdir(2).

       Infelicities in the protocol underlying NFS can cause the unexpected disappearance of files which are still being
       used.
