FREAD(3)                                        Linux Programmer's Manual                                       FREAD(3)

NAME
       fread, fwrite - binary stream input/output

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>

       size_t fread(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream);

       size_t fwrite(const void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb,
                     FILE *stream);

DESCRIPTION
       The function fread() reads nmemb items of data, each size bytes long, from the stream pointed to by stream, stor‐
       ing them at the location given by ptr.

       The function fwrite() writes nmemb items of data, each size bytes long, to the stream pointed to by  stream,  ob‐
       taining them from the location given by ptr.

       For nonlocking counterparts, see unlocked_stdio(3).

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  fread()  and fwrite() return the number of items read or written.  This number equals the number of
       bytes transferred only when size is 1.  If an error occurs, or the end of the file is reached, the  return  value
       is a short item count (or zero).

       fread()  does not distinguish between end-of-file and error, and callers must use feof(3) and ferror(3) to deter‐
       mine which occurred.
