CLOG2(3)                                        Linux Programmer's Manual                                       CLOG2(3)

NAME
       clog2, clog2f, clog2l - base-2 logarithm of a complex number

SYNOPSIS
       #include <complex.h>

       double complex clog2(double complex z);
       float complex clog2f(float complex z);
       long double complex clog2l(long double complex z);

DESCRIPTION
       The call clog2(z) is equivalent to clog(z)/log(2).

       The other functions perform the same task for float and long double.

       Note that z close to zero will cause an overflow.

CONFORMING TO
       These function names are reserved for future use in C99.

AVAILABILITY
       Not yet in glibc, as at version 2.19.
