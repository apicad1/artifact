FGETWS(3)                                       Linux Programmer's Manual                                      FGETWS(3)

NAME
       fgetws - read a wide-character string from a FILE stream

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wchar_t *fgetws(wchar_t *restrict ws, int n, FILE *restrict stream);

DESCRIPTION
       The  fgetws()  function  is the wide-character equivalent of the fgets(3) function.  It reads a string of at most
       n-1 wide characters into the wide-character array pointed to by ws, and adds a terminating  null  wide  character
       (L'\0').  It stops reading wide characters after it has encountered and stored a newline wide character.  It also
       stops when end of stream is reached.

       The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least n wide characters at ws.

       For a nonlocking counterpart, see unlocked_stdio(3).

RETURN VALUE
       The fgetws() function, if successful, returns ws.  If end of stream was already reached or if an error  occurred,
       it returns NULL.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, C99.

NOTES
       The behavior of fgetws() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the current locale.

       In  the  absence  of additional information passed to the fopen(3) call, it is reasonable to expect that fgetws()
       will actually read a multibyte string from the stream and then convert it to a wide-character string.

       This function is unreliable, because it does not permit to deal properly with null wide characters  that  may  be
       present in the input.
