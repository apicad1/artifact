FPATHCONF(3)                                    Linux Programmer's Manual                                   FPATHCONF(3)

NAME
       fpathconf, pathconf - get configuration values for files

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       long fpathconf(int fd, int name);
       long pathconf(const char *path, int name);

DESCRIPTION
       fpathconf() gets a value for the configuration option name for the open file descriptor fd.

       pathconf() gets a value for configuration option name for the filename path.

       The  corresponding  macros defined in <unistd.h> are minimum values; if an application wants to take advantage of
       values which may change, a call to fpathconf() or pathconf() can be made, which may yield more liberal results.

       Setting name equal to one of the following constants returns the following configuration options:

       _PC_LINK_MAX
              The maximum number of links to the file.  If fd or path refer to a directory, then the  value  applies  to
              the whole directory.  The corresponding macro is _POSIX_LINK_MAX.

       _PC_MAX_CANON
              The  maximum length of a formatted input line, where fd or path must refer to a terminal.  The correspond‐
              ing macro is _POSIX_MAX_CANON.

       _PC_MAX_INPUT
              The maximum length of an input line, where fd or path must refer to a terminal.  The  corresponding  macro
              is _POSIX_MAX_INPUT.

       _PC_NAME_MAX
              The  maximum  length of a filename in the directory path or fd that the process is allowed to create.  The
              corresponding macro is _POSIX_NAME_MAX.

       _PC_PATH_MAX
              The maximum length of a relative pathname when path or fd is the current working  directory.   The  corre‐
              sponding macro is _POSIX_PATH_MAX.

       _PC_PIPE_BUF
              The  maximum number of bytes that can be written atomically to a pipe of FIFO.  For fpathconf(), fd should
              refer to a pipe or FIFO.  For fpathconf(), path should refer to a FIFO or a directory; in the latter case,
              the  returned  value  corresponds  to  FIFOs  created  in  that  directory.   The  corresponding  macro is
              _POSIX_PIPE_BUF.

       _PC_CHOWN_RESTRICTED
              This returns a positive value if the use of chown(2) and fchown(2) for changing a file's user  ID  is  re‐
              stricted  to  a  process with appropriate privileges, and changing a file's group ID to a value other than
              the process's effective group ID or one of its supplementary group IDs is restricted to a process with ap‐
              propriate privileges.  According to POSIX.1, this variable shall always be defined with a value other than
              -1.  The corresponding macro is _POSIX_CHOWN_RESTRICTED.

              If fd or path refers to a directory, then the return value applies to all files in that directory.

       _PC_NO_TRUNC
              This returns nonzero if accessing filenames longer than _POSIX_NAME_MAX generates an  error.   The  corre‐
              sponding macro is _POSIX_NO_TRUNC.

       _PC_VDISABLE
              This  returns  nonzero  if  special character processing can be disabled, where fd or path must refer to a
              terminal.

RETURN VALUE
       The return value of these functions is one of the following:

       *  On error, -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the cause of the error (for example, EINVAL,  indicating
          that name is invalid).

       *  If  name  corresponds to a maximum or minimum limit, and that limit is indeterminate, -1 is returned and errno
          is not changed.  (To distinguish an indeterminate limit from an error, set errno to zero before the call,  and
          then check whether errno is nonzero when -1 is returned.)

       *  If  name corresponds to an option, a positive value is returned if the option is supported, and -1 is returned
          if the option is not supported.

       *  Otherwise, the current value of the option or limit is returned.  This value will not be more restrictive than
          the corresponding value that was described to the application in <unistd.h> or <limits.h> when the application
          was compiled.

ERRORS
       EACCES (pathconf()) Search permission is denied for one of the directories in the path prefix of path.

       EBADF  (fpathconf()) fd is not a valid file descriptor.

       EINVAL name is invalid.

       EINVAL The implementation does not support an association of name with the specified file.

       ELOOP  (pathconf()) Too many symbolic links were encountered while resolving path.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              (pathconf()) path is too long.

       ENOENT (pathconf()) A component of path does not exist, or path is an empty string.

       ENOTDIR
              (pathconf()) A component used as a directory in path is not in fact a directory.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008.

NOTES
       Files with name lengths longer than the value returned for name equal to _PC_NAME_MAX may exist in the given  di‐
       rectory.

       Some returned values may be huge; they are not suitable for allocating memory.
