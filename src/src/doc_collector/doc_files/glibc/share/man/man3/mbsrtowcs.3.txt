MBSRTOWCS(3)                                    Linux Programmer's Manual                                   MBSRTOWCS(3)

NAME
       mbsrtowcs - convert a multibyte string to a wide-character string

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       size_t mbsrtowcs(wchar_t *restrict dest, const char **restrict src,
                        size_t len, mbstate_t *restrict ps);

DESCRIPTION
       If  dest  is  not  NULL,  the  mbsrtowcs() function converts the multibyte string *src to a wide-character string
       starting at dest.  At most len wide characters are written to dest.  The shift state *ps is updated.  The conver‐
       sion  is  effectively performed by repeatedly calling mbrtowc(dest, *src, n, ps) where n is some positive number,
       as long as this call succeeds, and then incrementing dest by one and *src by the number of bytes  consumed.   The
       conversion can stop for three reasons:

       1. An invalid multibyte sequence has been encountered.  In this case, *src is left pointing to the invalid multi‐
          byte sequence, (size_t) -1 is returned, and errno is set to EILSEQ.

       2. len non-L'\0' wide characters have been stored at dest.  In this case, *src  is  left  pointing  to  the  next
          multibyte sequence to be converted, and the number of wide characters written to dest is returned.

       3. The  multibyte  string  has  been  completely converted, including the terminating null wide character ('\0'),
          which has the side effect of bringing back *ps to the initial state.  In this case, *src is set to  NULL,  and
          the number of wide characters written to dest, excluding the terminating null wide character, is returned.

       If  dest is NULL, len is ignored, and the conversion proceeds as above, except that the converted wide characters
       are not written out to memory, and that no length limit exists.

       In both of the above cases, if ps is NULL, a static anonymous state known only to  the  mbsrtowcs()  function  is
       used instead.

       The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least len wide characters at dest.

RETURN VALUE
       The  mbsrtowcs() function returns the number of wide characters that make up the converted part of the wide-char‐
       acter string, not including the terminating null wide character.  If an invalid multibyte  sequence  was  encoun‐
       tered, (size_t) -1 is returned, and errno set to EILSEQ.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, C99.

NOTES
       The behavior of mbsrtowcs() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the current locale.

       Passing NULL as ps is not multithread safe.
