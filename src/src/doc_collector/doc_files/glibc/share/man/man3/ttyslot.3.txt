TTYSLOT(3)                                      Linux Programmer's Manual                                     TTYSLOT(3)

NAME
       ttyslot - find the slot of the current user's terminal in some file

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>       /* See NOTES */

       int ttyslot(void);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       ttyslot():
           Since glibc 2.24:
               _DEFAULT_SOURCE
           From glibc 2.20 to 2.23:
               _DEFAULT_SOURCE || (_XOPEN_SOURCE && _XOPEN_SOURCE < 500)
           Glibc 2.19 and earlier:
               _BSD_SOURCE || (_XOPEN_SOURCE && _XOPEN_SOURCE < 500)

DESCRIPTION
       The legacy function ttyslot() returns the index of the current user's entry in some file.

       Now "What file?" you ask.  Well, let's first look at some history.

   Ancient history
       There  used  to  be a file /etc/ttys in UNIX V6, that was read by the init(1) program to find out what to do with
       each terminal line.  Each line consisted of three characters.  The first character was either '0' or  '1',  where
       '0'  meant  "ignore".  The second character denoted the terminal: '8' stood for "/dev/tty8".  The third character
       was an argument to getty(8) indicating the sequence of line speeds to try ('-' was: start trying 110 baud).  Thus
       a  typical line was "18-".  A hang on some line was solved by changing the '1' to a '0', signaling init, changing
       back again, and signaling init again.

       In UNIX V7 the format was changed: here the second character was the argument to getty(8) indicating the sequence
       of  line  speeds to try ('0' was: cycle through 300-1200-150-110 baud; '4' was for the on-line console DECwriter)
       while the rest of the line contained the name of the tty.  Thus a typical line was "14console".

       Later systems have more elaborate syntax.  System V-like systems have /etc/inittab instead.

   Ancient history (2)
       On the other hand, there is the file /etc/utmp listing the people currently logged in.  It is maintained  by  lo‐
       gin(1).   It  has  a fixed size, and the appropriate index in the file was determined by login(1) using the ttys‐
       lot() call to find the number of the line in /etc/ttys (counting from 1).

   The semantics of ttyslot
       Thus, the function ttyslot() returns the index of the controlling terminal of the calling  process  in  the  file
       /etc/ttys,  and  that is (usually) the same as the index of the entry for the current user in the file /etc/utmp.
       BSD still has the /etc/ttys file, but System V-like systems do not, and hence cannot refer to it.  Thus, on  such
       systems the documentation says that ttyslot() returns the current user's index in the user accounting data base.

RETURN VALUE
       If successful, this function returns the slot number.  On error (e.g., if none of the file descriptors 0, 1, or 2
       is associated with a terminal that occurs in this data base) it returns 0 on UNIX V6 and V7 and BSD-like systems,
       but -1 on System V-like systems.

CONFORMING TO
       SUSv1; marked as LEGACY in SUSv2; removed in POSIX.1-2001.  SUSv2 requires -1 on error.

NOTES
       The utmp file is found in various places on various systems, such as /etc/utmp, /var/adm/utmp, /var/run/utmp.

       The  glibc2  implementation of this function reads the file _PATH_TTYS, defined in <ttyent.h> as "/etc/ttys".  It
       returns 0 on error.  Since Linux systems do not usually have "/etc/ttys", it will always return 0.

       On BSD-like systems and Linux, the declaration of ttyslot() is provided by <unistd.h>.  On System V-like systems,
       the  declaration  is provided by <stdlib.h>.  Since glibc 2.24, <stdlib.h> also provides the declaration with the
       following feature test macro definitions:

           (_XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500 ||
                   (_XOPEN_SOURCE && _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED))
               && ! (_POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L || _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 600)

       Minix also has fttyslot(fd).
