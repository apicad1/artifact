GETENV(3)                                       Linux Programmer's Manual                                      GETENV(3)

NAME
       getenv, secure_getenv - get an environment variable

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       char *getenv(const char *name);

       char *secure_getenv(const char *name);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       secure_getenv(): _GNU_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  getenv() function searches the environment list to find the environment variable name, and returns a pointer
       to the corresponding value string.

       The GNU-specific secure_getenv() function is just like getenv() except that it returns NULL in cases  where  "se‐
       cure  execution"  is required.  Secure execution is required if one of the following conditions was true when the
       program run by the calling process was loaded:

       *  the process's effective user ID did not match its real user ID or the process's effective  group  ID  did  not
          match its real group ID (typically this is the result of executing a set-user-ID or set-group-ID program);

       *  the effective capability bit was set on the executable file; or

       *  the process has a nonempty permitted capability set.

       Secure execution may also be required if triggered by some Linux security modules.

       The secure_getenv() function is intended for use in general-purpose libraries to avoid vulnerabilities that could
       occur if set-user-ID or set-group-ID programs accidentally trusted the environment.

RETURN VALUE
       The getenv() function returns a pointer to the value in the environment, or NULL if there is no match.

VERSIONS
       secure_getenv() first appeared in glibc 2.17.

CONFORMING TO
       getenv(): POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, C89, C99, SVr4, 4.3BSD.

       secure_getenv() is a GNU extension.

NOTES
       The strings in the environment list are of the form name=value.

       As typically implemented, getenv() returns a pointer to a string within the environment list.   The  caller  must
       take care not to modify this string, since that would change the environment of the process.

       The  implementation  of  getenv()  is not required to be reentrant.  The string pointed to by the return value of
       getenv() may be statically allocated, and can be modified by a subsequent call to getenv(), putenv(3), setenv(3),
       or unsetenv(3).

       The  "secure  execution"  mode  of secure_getenv() is controlled by the AT_SECURE flag contained in the auxiliary
       vector passed from the kernel to user space.
