FMOD(3)                                         Linux Programmer's Manual                                        FMOD(3)

NAME
       fmod, fmodf, fmodl - floating-point remainder function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double fmod(double x, double y);
       float fmodf(float x, float y);
       long double fmodl(long double x, long double y);

       Link with -lm.

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       fmodf(), fmodl():
           _ISOC99_SOURCE || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L
               || /* Since glibc 2.19: */ _DEFAULT_SOURCE
               || /* Glibc versions <= 2.19: */ _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       These  functions compute the floating-point remainder of dividing x by y.  The return value is x - n * y, where n
       is the quotient of x / y, rounded toward zero to an integer.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these functions return the value x - n*y, for some integer n, such that the returned  value  has  the
       same sign as x and a magnitude less than the magnitude of y.

       If x or y is a NaN, a NaN is returned.

       If x is an infinity, a domain error occurs, and a NaN is returned.

       If y is zero, a domain error occurs, and a NaN is returned.

       If x is +0 (-0), and y is not zero, +0 (-0) is returned.

ERRORS
       See math_error(7) for information on how to determine whether an error has occurred when calling these functions.

       The following errors can occur:

       Domain error: x is an infinity
              errno is set to EDOM (but see BUGS).  An invalid floating-point exception (FE_INVALID) is raised.

       Domain error: y is zero
              errno is set to EDOM.  An invalid floating-point exception (FE_INVALID) is raised.

CONFORMING TO
       C99, POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008.

       The variant returning double also conforms to SVr4, 4.3BSD, C89.

BUGS
       Before version 2.10, the glibc implementation did not set errno to EDOM when a domain error occurred for an infi‐
       nite x.
