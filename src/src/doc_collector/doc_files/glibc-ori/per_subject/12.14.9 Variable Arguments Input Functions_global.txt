The functions vscanf and friends are provided so that you can define your own variadic scanf-like functions that make use of the same internals as the built-in formatted output functions. These functions are analogous to the vprintf series of output functions.  See Variable Arguments Output, for important information on how to use them. 
Portability Note: The functions listed in this section were introduced in ISOÂ C99 and were before available as GNU extensions. 
In GNU C, there is a special construct you can use to let the compiler know that a function uses a scanf-style format string.  Then it can check the number and types of arguments in each call to the function, and warn you when they do not match the format string. For details, see Declaring Attributes of Functions in Using GNU CC.
