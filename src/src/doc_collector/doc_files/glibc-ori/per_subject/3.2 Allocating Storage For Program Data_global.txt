This section covers how ordinary programs manage storage for their data, including the famous malloc function and some fancier facilities special to the GNU C Library and GNU Compiler. 

TABLE_BEGIN
 • Memory Allocation and C    How to get different kinds of allocation in C.

 • The GNU Allocator    An overview of the GNU malloc
				implementation.

 • Unconstrained Allocation    The malloc facility allows fully general
		 		 dynamic allocation.

 • Allocation Debugging    Finding memory leaks and not freed memory.

 • Replacing malloc    Using your own malloc-style allocator.

 • Obstacks    Obstacks are less general than malloc
				 but more efficient and convenient.

 • Variable Size Automatic    Allocation of variable-sized blocks
				 of automatic storage that are freed when the
				 calling function returns.
