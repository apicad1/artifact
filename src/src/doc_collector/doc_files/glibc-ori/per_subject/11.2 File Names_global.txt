In order to open a connection to a file, or to perform other operations such as deleting a file, you need some way to refer to the file.  Nearly all files have names that are strings—even files which are actually devices such as tape drives or terminals.  These strings are called file names.  You specify the file name to say which file you want to open or operate on. 
This section describes the conventions for file names and how the operating system works with them.
