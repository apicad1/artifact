This section describes how to do input and output operations on blocks of data.  You can use these functions to read and write binary data, as well as to read and write text in fixed-size blocks instead of by characters or lines.     
Binary files are typically used to read and write blocks of data in the same format as is used to represent the data in a running program.  In other words, arbitrary blocks of memory—not just character or string objects—can be written to a binary file, and meaningfully read in again by the same program. 
Storing data in binary form is often considerably more efficient than using the formatted I/O functions.  Also, for floating-point numbers, the binary form avoids possible loss of precision in the conversion process.  On the other hand, binary files can’t be examined or modified easily using many standard file utilities (such as text editors), and are not portable between different implementations of the language, or different kinds of computers. 
These functions are declared in stdio.h.
