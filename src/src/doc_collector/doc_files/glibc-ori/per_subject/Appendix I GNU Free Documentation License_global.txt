EXAMPLE_BEGIN
  Copyright (C)  year  your name.
  Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document

  Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU

EXAMPLE_END

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the “with…Texts.” line with this: 

EXAMPLE_BEGIN
    with the Invariant Sections being list their titles, with
    the Front-Cover Texts being list, and with the Back-Cover Texts
    being list.
EXAMPLE_END

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation. 
If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.
