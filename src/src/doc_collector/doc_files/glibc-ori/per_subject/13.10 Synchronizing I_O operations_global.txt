In most modern operating systems, the normal I/O operations are not executed synchronously.  I.e., even if a write system call returns, this does not mean the data is actually written to the media, e.g., the disk. 
In situations where synchronization points are necessary, you can use special functions which ensure that all operations finish before they return. 
Programs more often want to ensure that data written to a given file is committed, rather than all data in the system.  For this, sync is overkill. 
Sometimes it is not even necessary to write all data associated with a file descriptor.  E.g., in database files which do not change in size it is enough to write all the file content data to the device. Meta-information, like the modification time etc., are not that important and leaving such information uncommitted does not prevent a successful recovery of the file in case of a problem.
