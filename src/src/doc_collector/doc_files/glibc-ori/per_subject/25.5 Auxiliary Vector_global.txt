When a program is executed, it receives information from the operating system about the environment in which it is operating.  The form of this information is a table of key-value pairs, where the keys are from the set of ‘AT_’ values in elf.h.  Some of the data is provided by the kernel for libc consumption, and may be obtained by ordinary interfaces, such as sysconf.  However, on a platform-by-platform basis there may be information that is not available any other way. 
For some platforms, the key AT_HWCAP is the easiest way to inquire about any instruction set extensions available at runtime.  In this case, there will (of necessity) be a platform-specific set of ‘HWCAP_’ values masked together that describe the capabilities of the cpu on which the program is being executed.
