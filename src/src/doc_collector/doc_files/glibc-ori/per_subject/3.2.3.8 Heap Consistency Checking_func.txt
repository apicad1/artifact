- Function: int mcheck (void (*abortfn) (enum mcheck_status status))
Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:mcheck const:malloc_hooks | AS-Unsafe corrupt | AC-Unsafe corrupt | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
Calling mcheck tells malloc to perform occasional consistency checks.  These will catch things such as writing past the end of a block that was allocated with malloc. 
The abortfn argument is the function to call when an inconsistency is found.  If you supply a null pointer, then mcheck uses a default function which prints a message and calls abort (see Aborting a Program).  The function you supply is called with one argument, which says what sort of inconsistency was detected; its type is described below. 
It is too late to begin allocation checking once you have allocated anything with malloc.  So mcheck does nothing in that case.  The function returns -1 if you call it too late, and 0 otherwise (when it is successful). 
The easiest way to arrange to call mcheck early enough is to use the option ‘-lmcheck’ when you link your program; then you don’t need to modify your program source at all.  Alternatively you might use a debugger to insert a call to mcheck whenever the program is started, for example these gdb commands will automatically call mcheck whenever the program starts: 

EXAMPLE_BEGIN
(gdb) break main
Breakpoint 1, main (argc=2, argv=0xbffff964) at whatever.c:10
(gdb) command 1
Type commands for when breakpoint 1 is hit, one per line.
End with a line saying just "end".
>call mcheck(0)
>continue
>end
(gdb) …
EXAMPLE_END

This will however only work if no initialization function of any object involved calls any of the malloc functions since mcheck must be called before the first such function.

- Function: enum mcheck_status mprobe (void *pointer)
Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:mcheck const:malloc_hooks | AS-Unsafe corrupt | AC-Unsafe corrupt | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
The mprobe function lets you explicitly check for inconsistencies in a particular allocated block.  You must have already called mcheck at the beginning of the program, to do its occasional checks; calling mprobe requests an additional consistency check to be done at the time of the call. 
The argument pointer must be a pointer returned by malloc or realloc.  mprobe returns a value that says what inconsistency, if any, was found.  The values are described below.

- Data Type: enum mcheck_status
This enumerated type describes what kind of inconsistency was detected in an allocated block, if any.  Here are the possible values: 
	MCHECK_DISABLED
mcheck was not called before the first allocation. No consistency checking can be done. 
	MCHECK_OK
No inconsistency detected. 
	MCHECK_HEAD
The data immediately before the block was modified. This commonly happens when an array index or pointer is decremented too far. 
	MCHECK_TAIL
The data immediately after the block was modified. This commonly happens when an array index or pointer is incremented too far. 
	MCHECK_FREE
The block was already freed.
