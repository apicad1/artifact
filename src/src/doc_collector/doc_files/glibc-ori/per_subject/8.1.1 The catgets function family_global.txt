Please note that the currently selected locale does not depend on a call to the setlocale function.  It is not necessary that the locale data files for this locale exist and calling setlocale succeeds. The catopen function directly reads the values of the environment variables. 
It is somewhat uncomfortable to write a program using the catgets functions if no supporting functionality is available.  Since each set/message number tuple must be unique the programmer must keep lists of the messages at the same time the code is written.  And the work between several people working on the same project must be coordinated. We will see how some of these problems can be relaxed a bit (see Common Usage).
