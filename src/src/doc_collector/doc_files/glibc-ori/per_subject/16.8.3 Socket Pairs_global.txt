A socket pair consists of a pair of connected (but unnamed) sockets.  It is very similar to a pipe and is used in much the same way.  Socket pairs are created with the socketpair function, declared in sys/socket.h.  A socket pair is much like a pipe; the main difference is that the socket pair is bidirectional, whereas the pipe has one input-only end and one output-only end (see Pipes and FIFOs).
