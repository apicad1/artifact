This chapter describes the GNU C Library’s functions for manipulating files.  Unlike the input and output functions (see I/O on Streams; see Low-Level I/O), these functions are concerned with operating on the files themselves rather than on their contents. 
Among the facilities described in this chapter are functions for examining or modifying directories, functions for renaming and deleting files, and functions for examining and setting file attributes such as access permissions and modification times.
