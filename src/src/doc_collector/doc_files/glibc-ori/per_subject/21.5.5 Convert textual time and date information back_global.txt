The ISO C standard does not specify any functions which can convert the output of the strftime function back into a binary format. This led to a variety of more-or-less successful implementations with different interfaces over the years.  Then the Unix standard was extended by the addition of two functions: strptime and getdate.  Both have strange interfaces but at least they are widely available.
