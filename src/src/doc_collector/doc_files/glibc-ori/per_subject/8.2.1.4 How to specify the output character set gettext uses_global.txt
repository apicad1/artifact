gettext not only looks up a translation in a message catalog, it also converts the translation on the fly to the desired output character set.  This is useful if the user is working in a different character set than the translator who created the message catalog, because it avoids distributing variants of message catalogs which differ only in the character set. 
The output character set is, by default, the value of nl_langinfo (CODESET), which depends on the LC_CTYPE part of the current locale.  But programs which store strings in a locale independent way (e.g. UTF-8) can request that gettext and related functions return the translations in that encoding, by use of the bind_textdomain_codeset function. 
Note that the msgid argument to gettext is not subject to character set conversion.  Also, when gettext does not find a translation for msgid, it returns msgid unchanged â€“ independently of the current output character set.  It is therefore recommended that all msgids be US-ASCII strings.
