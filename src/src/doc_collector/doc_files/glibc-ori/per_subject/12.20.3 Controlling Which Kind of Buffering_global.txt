After opening a stream (but before any other operations have been performed on it), you can explicitly specify what kind of buffering you want it to have using the setvbuf function.  
The facilities listed in this section are declared in the header file stdio.h.  
It is possible to query whether a given stream is line buffered or not using a non-standard function introduced in Solaris and available in the GNU C Library. 
Two more extensions allow to determine the size of the buffer and how much of it is used.  These functions were also introduced in Solaris.
