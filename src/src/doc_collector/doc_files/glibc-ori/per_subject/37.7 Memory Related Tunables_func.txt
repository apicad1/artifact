- Tunable: glibc.mem.tagging
If the hardware supports memory tagging, this tunable can be used to control the way the GNU C Library uses this feature.  At present this is only supported on AArch64 systems with the MTE extention; it is ignored for all other systems. 
This tunable takes a value between 0 and 255 and acts as a bitmask that enables various capabilities. 
Bit 0 (the least significant bit) causes the malloc subsystem to allocate tagged memory, with each allocation being assigned a random tag. 
Bit 1 enables precise faulting mode for tag violations on systems that support deferred tag violation reporting.  This may cause programs to run more slowly. 
Other bits are currently reserved. 
The GNU C Library startup code will automatically enable memory tagging support in the kernel if this tunable has any non-zero value. 
The default value is ‘0’, which disables all memory tagging.
