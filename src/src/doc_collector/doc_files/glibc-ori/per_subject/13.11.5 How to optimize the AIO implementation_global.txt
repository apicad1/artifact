The POSIX standard does not specify how the AIO functions are implemented.  They could be system calls, but it is also possible to emulate them at userlevel. 
At the time of writing, the available implementation is a user-level implementation which uses threads for handling the enqueued requests. While this implementation requires making some decisions about limitations, hard limitations are something best avoided in the GNU C Library.  Therefore, the GNU C Library provides a means for tuning the AIO implementation according to the individual use.
