When you are finished using a compiled regular expression, you can free the storage it uses by calling regfree. 
You should always free the space in a regex_t structure with regfree before using the structure to compile another regular expression. 
When regcomp or regexec reports an error, you can use the function regerror to turn it into an error message string.
