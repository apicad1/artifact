- Data Type: sigjmp_buf
This is similar to jmp_buf, except that it can also store state information about the set of blocked signals.

- Function: int sigsetjmp (sigjmp_buf state, int savesigs)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Unsafe lock/hurd | AC-Unsafe lock/hurd | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
This is similar to setjmp.  If savesigs is nonzero, the set of blocked signals is saved in state and will be restored if a siglongjmp is later performed with this state.

- Function: void siglongjmp (sigjmp_buf state, int value)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Unsafe plugin corrupt lock/hurd | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock/hurd | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
This is similar to longjmp except for the type of its state argument.  If the sigsetjmp call that set this state used a nonzero savesigs flag, siglongjmp also restores the set of blocked signals.
