The function below addresses the perennial programming quandary: “How do I take good data in string form and painlessly turn it into garbage?” This is not a difficult thing to code for oneself, but the authors of the GNU C Library wish to make it as convenient as possible. 
To erase data, use explicit_bzero (see Erasing Sensitive Data); to obfuscate it reversibly, use memfrob (see Obfuscating Data).
