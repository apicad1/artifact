Together with the setlocale function the ISO C people invented the localeconv function.  It is a masterpiece of poor design.  It is expensive to use, not extensible, and not generally usable as it provides access to only LC_MONETARY and LC_NUMERIC related information.  Nevertheless, if it is applicable to a given situation it should be used since it is very portable.  The function strfmon formats monetary amounts according to the selected locale using this information.    
If a member of the structure struct lconv has type char, and the value is CHAR_MAX, it means that the current locale has no value for that parameter.
