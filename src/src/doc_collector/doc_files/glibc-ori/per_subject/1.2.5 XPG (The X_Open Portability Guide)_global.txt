The X/Open Portability Guide, published by the X/Open Company, Ltd., is a more general standard than POSIX.  X/Open owns the Unix copyright and the XPG specifies the requirements for systems which are intended to be a Unix system. 
The GNU C Library complies to the X/Open Portability Guide, Issue 4.2, with all extensions common to XSI (X/Open System Interface) compliant systems and also all X/Open UNIX extensions. 
The additions on top of POSIX are mainly derived from functionality available in System V and BSD systems.  Some of the really bad mistakes in System V systems were corrected, though.  Since fulfilling the XPG standard with the Unix extensions is a precondition for getting the Unix brand chances are good that the functionality is available on commercial systems.
