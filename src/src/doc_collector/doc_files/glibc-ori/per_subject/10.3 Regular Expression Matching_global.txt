The GNU C Library supports two interfaces for matching regular expressions.  One is the standard POSIX.2 interface, and the other is what the GNU C Library has had for many years. 
Both interfaces are declared in the header file regex.h. If you define _POSIX_C_SOURCE, then only the POSIX.2 functions, structures, and constants are declared.
