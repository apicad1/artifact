The POSIX.2 standard specifies certain system limits that you can access through sysconf that apply to utility behavior rather than the behavior of the library or the operating system. 
The GNU C Library defines macros for these limits, and sysconf returns values for them if you ask; but these values convey no meaningful information.  They are simply the smallest values that POSIX.2 permits.
