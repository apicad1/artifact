To accept GNU-style long options as well as single-character options, use getopt_long instead of getopt.  This function is declared in getopt.h, not unistd.h.  You should make every program accept long options if it uses any options, for this takes little extra work and helps beginners remember how to use the program. 
Since long option names were used before getopt_long was invented there are program interfaces which require programs to recognize options like ‘-option value’ instead of ‘--option value’.  To enable these programs to use the GNU getopt functionality there is one more function available.
