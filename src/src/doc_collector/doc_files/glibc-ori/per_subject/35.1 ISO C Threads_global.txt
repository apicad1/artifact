This section describes the GNU C Library ISO C threads implementation. To have a deeper understanding of this API, it is strongly recommended to read ISO/IEC 9899:2011, section 7.26, in which ISO C threads were originally specified.  All types and function prototypes are declared in the header file threads.h.
