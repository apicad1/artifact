- Function: int rpmatch (const char *response)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe locale | AS-Unsafe corrupt heap lock dlopen | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock mem fd | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
The function rpmatch checks the string in response for whether or not it is a correct yes-or-no answer and if yes, which one.  The check uses the YESEXPR and NOEXPR data in the LC_MESSAGES category of the currently selected locale.  The return value is as follows: 
	1
The user entered an affirmative answer.  
	0
The user entered a negative answer.  
	-1
The answer matched neither the YESEXPR nor the NOEXPR regular expression. 
This function is not standardized but available beside in the GNU C Library at least also in the IBM AIX library.
