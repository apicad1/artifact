A process can send itself a signal with the raise function.  This function is declared in signal.h.  
One convenient use for raise is to reproduce the default behavior of a signal that you have trapped.  For instance, suppose a user of your program types the SUSP character (usually C-z; see Special Characters) to send it an interactive stop signal (SIGTSTP), and you want to clean up some internal data buffers before stopping.  You might set this up like this: 

EXAMPLE_BEGIN
#include <signal.h>

/* When a stop signal arrives, set the action back to the default
   and then resend the signal after doing cleanup actions. */

void
tstp_handler (int sig)
{
  signal (SIGTSTP, SIG_DFL);
  /* Do cleanup actions here. */
  …
  raise (SIGTSTP);
}

/* When the process is continued again, restore the signal handler. */

void
cont_handler (int sig)
{
  signal (SIGCONT, cont_handler);
  signal (SIGTSTP, tstp_handler);
}

/* Enable both handlers during program initialization. */

int
main (void)
{
  signal (SIGCONT, cont_handler);
  signal (SIGTSTP, tstp_handler);
  …
}
EXAMPLE_END

Portability note: raise was invented by the ISO C committee.  Older systems may not support it, so using kill may be more portable.  See Signaling Another Process.
