Each network interface has a name.  This usually consists of a few letters that relate to the type of interface, which may be followed by a number if there is more than one interface of that type.  Examples might be lo (the loopback interface) and eth0 (the first Ethernet interface). 
Although such names are convenient for humans, it would be clumsy to have to use them whenever a program needs to refer to an interface.  In such situations an interface is referred to by its index, which is an arbitrarily-assigned small positive integer. 
The following functions, constants and data types are declared in the header file net/if.h.
