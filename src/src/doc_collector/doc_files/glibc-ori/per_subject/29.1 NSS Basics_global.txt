The basic idea is to put the implementation of the different services offered to access the databases in separate modules.  This has some advantages: 
To fulfill the first goal above, the ABI of the modules will be described below.  For getting the implementation of a new service right it is important to understand how the functions in the modules get called. They are in no way designed to be used by the programmer directly. Instead the programmer should only use the documented and standardized functions to access the databases. 
The databases available in the NSS are 
More databases may be added later.
