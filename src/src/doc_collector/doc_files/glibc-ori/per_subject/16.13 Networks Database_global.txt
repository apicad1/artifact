Many systems come with a database that records a list of networks known to the system developer.  This is usually kept either in the file /etc/networks or in an equivalent from a name server.  This data base is useful for routing programs such as route, but it is not useful for programs that simply communicate over the network.  We provide functions to access this database, which are declared in netdb.h. 
Use the getnetbyname or getnetbyaddr functions to search the networks database for information about a specific network.  The information is returned in a statically-allocated structure; you must copy the information if you need to save it. 
You can also scan the networks database using setnetent, getnetent and endnetent.  Be careful when using these functions because they are not reentrant.
