- Function: int sigsuspend (const sigset_t *set)
Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:sigprocmask/!bsd!linux | AS-Unsafe lock/hurd | AC-Unsafe lock/hurd | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
This function replaces the processâ€™s signal mask with set and then suspends the process until a signal is delivered whose action is either to terminate the process or invoke a signal handling function.  In other words, the program is effectively suspended until one of the signals that is not a member of set arrives. 
If the process is woken up by delivery of a signal that invokes a handler function, and the handler function returns, then sigsuspend also returns. 
The mask remains set only as long as sigsuspend is waiting. The function sigsuspend always restores the previous signal mask when it returns. 
The return value and error conditions are the same as for pause.
