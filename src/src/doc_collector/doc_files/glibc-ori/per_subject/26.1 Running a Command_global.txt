The easy way to run another program is to use the system function.  This function does all the work of running a subprogram, but it doesn’t give you much control over the details: you have to wait until the subprogram terminates before you can do anything else. 
Portability Note: Some C implementations may not have any notion of a command processor that can execute other programs.  You can determine whether a command processor exists by executing system (NULL); if the return value is nonzero, a command processor is available. 
The popen and pclose functions (see Pipe to a Subprocess) are closely related to the system function.  They allow the parent process to communicate with the standard input and output channels of the command being executed.
