This chapter describes functions that are specific to terminal devices. You can use these functions to do things like turn off input echoing; set serial line characteristics such as line speed and flow control; and change which characters are used for end-of-file, command-line editing, sending signals, and similar control functions. 
Most of the functions in this chapter operate on file descriptors. See Low-Level I/O, for more information about what a file descriptor is and how to open a file descriptor for a terminal device.
