The functions described so far for handling the files in a directory have allowed you to either retrieve the information bit by bit, or to process all the files as a group (see scandir).  Sometimes it is useful to process whole hierarchies of directories and their contained files.  The X/Open specification defines two functions to do this.  The simpler form is derived from an early definition in SystemÂ V systems and therefore this function is available on SVID-derived systems.  The prototypes and required definitions can be found in the ftw.h header. 
There are four functions in this family: ftw, nftw and their 64-bit counterparts ftw64 and nftw64.  These functions take as one of their arguments a pointer to a callback function of the appropriate type. 
For the LFS interface and for use in the function ftw64, the header ftw.h defines another function type. 
For the LFS interface there is also a variant of this data type available which has to be used with the nftw64 function.
