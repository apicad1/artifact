The GNU C Library also provides the wait3 function for compatibility with BSD.  This function is declared in sys/wait.h.  It is the predecessor to wait4, which is more flexible.  wait3 is now obsolete.  

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- Function: pid_t wait3 (int *status-ptr, int options, struct rusage *usage)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Safe  | AC-Safe  | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
If usage is a null pointer, wait3 is equivalent to waitpid (-1, status-ptr, options). 
If usage is not null, wait3 stores usage figures for the child process in *rusage (but only if the child has terminated, not if it has stopped).  See Resource Usage.
