The functions described in this section are primarily provided as a way to efficiently perform certain low-level manipulations on floating point numbers that are represented internally using a binary radix; see Floating Point Concepts.  These functions are required to have equivalent behavior even if the representation does not use a radix of 2, but of course they are unlikely to be particularly efficient in those cases. 
All these functions are declared in math.h. 
The following functions, which come from BSD, provide facilities equivalent to those of ldexp and frexp.  See also the ISOÂ C function logb which originally also appeared in BSD. The _FloatN and _FloatN variants of the following functions come from TS 18661-3:2015.
