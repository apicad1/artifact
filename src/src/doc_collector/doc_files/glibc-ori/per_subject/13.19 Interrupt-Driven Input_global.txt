If you set the O_ASYNC status flag on a file descriptor (see File Status Flags), a SIGIO signal is sent whenever input or output becomes possible on that file descriptor.  The process or process group to receive the signal can be selected by using the F_SETOWN command to the fcntl function.  If the file descriptor is a socket, this also selects the recipient of SIGURG signals that are delivered when out-of-band data arrives on that socket; see Out-of-Band Data.  (SIGURG is sent in any situation where select would report the socket as having an “exceptional condition”.  See Waiting for I/O.) 
If the file descriptor corresponds to a terminal device, then SIGIO signals are sent to the foreground process group of the terminal. See Job Control. 
The symbols in this section are defined in the header file fcntl.h.
