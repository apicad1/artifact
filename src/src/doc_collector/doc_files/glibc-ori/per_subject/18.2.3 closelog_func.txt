- Function: void closelog (void)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Unsafe lock | AC-Unsafe lock fd | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
closelog closes the current Syslog connection, if there is one. This includes closing the /dev/log socket, if it is open. closelog also sets the identification string for Syslog messages back to the default, if openlog was called with a non-NULL argument to ident.  The default identification string is the program name taken from argv[0]. 
If you are writing shared library code that uses openlog to generate custom syslog output, you should use closelog to drop the GNU C Libraryâ€™s internal reference to the ident pointer when you are done.  Please read the section on openlog for more information: See openlog. 
closelog does not flush any buffers.  You do not have to call closelog before re-opening a Syslog connection with openlog. Syslog connections are automatically closed on exec or exit.
