The amount of memory available in the system and the way it is organized determines oftentimes the way programs can and have to work.  For functions like mmap it is necessary to know about the size of individual memory pages and knowing how much memory is available enables a program to select appropriate sizes for, say, caches.  Before we get into these details a few words about memory subsystems in traditional Unix systems will be given.
