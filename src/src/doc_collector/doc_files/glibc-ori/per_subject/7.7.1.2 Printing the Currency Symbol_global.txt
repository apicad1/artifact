These members of the struct lconv structure specify how to print the symbol to identify a monetary value—the international analog of ‘$’ for US dollars. 
Each country has two standard currency symbols.  The local currency symbol is used commonly within the country, while the international currency symbol is used internationally to refer to that country’s currency when it is necessary to indicate the country unambiguously. 
For example, many countries use the dollar as their monetary unit, and when dealing with international currencies it’s important to specify that one is dealing with (say) Canadian dollars instead of U.S. dollars or Australian dollars.  But when the context is known to be Canada, there is no need to make this explicit—dollar amounts are implicitly assumed to be in Canadian dollars.
