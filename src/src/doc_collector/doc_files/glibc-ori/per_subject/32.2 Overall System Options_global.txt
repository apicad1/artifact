POSIX defines certain system-specific options that not all POSIX systems support.  Since these options are provided in the kernel, not in the library, simply using the GNU C Library does not guarantee any of these features are supported; it depends on the system you are using. 
You can test for the availability of a given option using the macros in this section, together with the function sysconf.  The macros are defined only if you include unistd.h. 
For the following macros, if the macro is defined in unistd.h, then the option is supported.  Otherwise, the option may or may not be supported; use sysconf to find out.  See Sysconf. 
For the following macros, if the macro is defined in unistd.h, then its value indicates whether the option is supported.  A value of -1 means no, and any other value means yes.  If the macro is not defined, then the option may or may not be supported; use sysconf to find out.  See Sysconf.
