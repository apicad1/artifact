This program doesn’t use any options or arguments, it uses argp to be compliant with the GNU standard command line format. 
In addition to giving no arguments and implementing a ‘--help’ option, this example has a ‘--version’ option, which will put the given documentation string and bug address in the ‘--help’ output, as per GNU standards. 
The variable argp contains the argument parser specification.  Adding fields to this structure is the way most parameters are passed to argp_parse.  The first three fields are normally used, but they are not in this small program.  There are also two global variables that argp can use defined here, argp_program_version and argp_program_bug_address.  They are considered global variables because they will almost always be constant for a given program, even if they use different argument parsers for various tasks.
