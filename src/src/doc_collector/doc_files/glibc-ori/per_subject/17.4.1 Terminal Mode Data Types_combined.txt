The entire collection of attributes of a terminal is stored in a structure of type struct termios.  This structure is used with the functions tcgetattr and tcsetattr to read and set the attributes. 

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- Data Type: struct termios
A struct termios records all the I/O attributes of a terminal.  The structure includes at least the following members: 
	tcflag_t c_iflag
A bit mask specifying flags for input modes; see Input Modes.  
	tcflag_t c_oflag
A bit mask specifying flags for output modes; see Output Modes.  
	tcflag_t c_cflag
A bit mask specifying flags for control modes; see Control Modes.  
	tcflag_t c_lflag
A bit mask specifying flags for local modes; see Local Modes.  
	cc_t c_cc[NCCS]
An array specifying which characters are associated with various control functions; see Special Characters. 
The struct termios structure also contains members which encode input and output transmission speeds, but the representation is not specified.  See Line Speed, for how to examine and store the speed values.

The following sections describe the details of the members of the struct termios structure. 

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- Data Type: tcflag_t
This is an unsigned integer type used to represent the various bit masks for terminal flags.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- Data Type: cc_t
This is an unsigned integer type used to represent characters associated with various terminal control functions.

- Macro: int NCCS
The value of this macro is the number of elements in the c_cc array.
