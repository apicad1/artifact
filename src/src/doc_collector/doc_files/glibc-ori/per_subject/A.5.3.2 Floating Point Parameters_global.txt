These macro definitions can be accessed by including the header file float.h in your program. 
Macro names starting with ‘FLT_’ refer to the float type, while names beginning with ‘DBL_’ refer to the double type and names beginning with ‘LDBL_’ refer to the long double type.  (If GCC does not support long double as a distinct data type on a target machine then the values for the ‘LDBL_’ constants are equal to the corresponding constants for the double type.) 
Of these macros, only FLT_RADIX is guaranteed to be a constant expression.  The other macros listed here cannot be reliably used in places that require constant expressions, such as ‘#if’ preprocessing directives or in the dimensions of static arrays. 
Although the ISO C standard specifies minimum and maximum values for most of these parameters, the GNU C implementation uses whatever values describe the floating point representation of the target machine.  So in principle GNU C actually satisfies the ISO C requirements only if the target machine is suitable.  In practice, all the machines currently supported are suitable.
