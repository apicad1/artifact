When reading in a passphrase, it is desirable to avoid displaying it on the screen, to help keep it secret.  The following function handles this in a convenient way. 
This precise set of operations may not suit all possible situations.  In this case, it is recommended that users write their own getpass substitute.  For instance, a very simple substitute is as follows: 

EXAMPLE_BEGIN


#include <termios.h>
#include <stdio.h>

ssize_t
my_getpass (char **lineptr, size_t *n, FILE *stream)
{
  struct termios old, new;
  int nread;

  /* Turn echoing off and fail if we canâ€™t. */
  if (tcgetattr (fileno (stream), &old) != 0)
    return -1;
  new = old;
  new.c_lflag &= ~ECHO;
  if (tcsetattr (fileno (stream), TCSAFLUSH, &new) != 0)
    return -1;

  /* Read the passphrase */
  nread = getline (lineptr, n, stream);

  /* Restore terminal. */
  (void) tcsetattr (fileno (stream), TCSAFLUSH, &old);

  return nread;
}
EXAMPLE_END

The substitute takes the same parameters as getline (see Line Input); the user must print any prompt desired.
