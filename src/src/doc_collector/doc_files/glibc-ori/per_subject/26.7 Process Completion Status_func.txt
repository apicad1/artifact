- Macro: int WIFEXITED (int status)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Safe  | AC-Safe  | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
This macro returns a nonzero value if the child process terminated normally with exit or _exit. 
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- Macro: int WEXITSTATUS (int status)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Safe  | AC-Safe  | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
If WIFEXITED is true of status, this macro returns the low-order 8 bits of the exit status value from the child process. See Exit Status.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- Macro: int WIFSIGNALED (int status)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Safe  | AC-Safe  | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
This macro returns a nonzero value if the child process terminated because it received a signal that was not handled. See Signal Handling. 
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- Macro: int WTERMSIG (int status)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Safe  | AC-Safe  | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
If WIFSIGNALED is true of status, this macro returns the signal number of the signal that terminated the child process.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- Macro: int WCOREDUMP (int status)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Safe  | AC-Safe  | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
This macro returns a nonzero value if the child process terminated and produced a core dump. 
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- Macro: int WIFSTOPPED (int status)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Safe  | AC-Safe  | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
This macro returns a nonzero value if the child process is stopped. 
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- Macro: int WSTOPSIG (int status)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Safe  | AC-Safe  | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
If WIFSTOPPED is true of status, this macro returns the signal number of the signal that caused the child process to stop.
