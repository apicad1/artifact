Here is a pictorial explanation of unreading.  Suppose you have a stream reading a file that contains just six characters, the letters ‘foobar’.  Suppose you have read three characters so far.  The situation looks like this: 

EXAMPLE_BEGIN
f  o  o  b  a  r
	 ^
EXAMPLE_END

so the next input character will be ‘b’. 
If instead of reading ‘b’ you unread the letter ‘o’, you get a situation like this: 

EXAMPLE_BEGIN
f  o  o  b  a  r
	 |
      o--
      ^
EXAMPLE_END

so that the next input characters will be ‘o’ and ‘b’. 
If you unread ‘9’ instead of ‘o’, you get this situation: 

EXAMPLE_BEGIN
f  o  o  b  a  r
	 |
      9--
      ^
EXAMPLE_END

so that the next input characters will be ‘9’ and ‘b’.
