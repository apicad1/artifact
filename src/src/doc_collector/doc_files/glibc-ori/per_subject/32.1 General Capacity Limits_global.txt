The POSIX.1 and POSIX.2 standards specify a number of parameters that describe capacity limitations of the system.  These limits can be fixed constants for a given operating system, or they can vary from machine to machine.  For example, some limit values may be configurable by the system administrator, either at run time or by rebuilding the kernel, and this should not require recompiling application programs. 
Each of the following limit parameters has a macro that is defined in limits.h only if the system has a fixed, uniform limit for the parameter in question.  If the system allows different file systems or files to have different limits, then the macro is undefined; use sysconf to find out the limit that applies at a particular time on a particular machine.  See Sysconf. 
Each of these parameters also has another macro, with a name starting with ‘_POSIX’, which gives the lowest value that the limit is allowed to have on any POSIX system.  See Minimums. 
These limit macros are always defined in limits.h.
