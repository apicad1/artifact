- Data type: struct __gconv_step
This data structure describes one conversion a module can perform.  For each function in a loaded module with conversion functions there is exactly one object of this type.  This object is shared by all users of the conversion (i.e., this object does not contain any information corresponding to an actual conversion; it only describes the conversion itself). 
	struct __gconv_loaded_object *__shlib_handle
	const char *__modname
	int __counter
All these elements of the structure are used internally in the C library to coordinate loading and unloading the shared object.  One must not expect any of the other elements to be available or initialized.  
	const char *__from_name
	const char *__to_name
__from_name and __to_name contain the names of the source and destination character sets.  They can be used to identify the actual conversion to be carried out since one module might implement conversions for more than one character set and/or direction.  
	gconv_fct __fct
	gconv_init_fct __init_fct
	gconv_end_fct __end_fct
These elements contain pointers to the functions in the loadable module. The interface will be explained below.  
	int __min_needed_from
	int __max_needed_from
	int __min_needed_to
	int __max_needed_to;
These values have to be supplied in the init function of the module.  The __min_needed_from value specifies how many bytes a character of the source character set at least needs.  The __max_needed_from specifies the maximum value that also includes possible shift sequences.  The __min_needed_to and __max_needed_to values serve the same purpose as __min_needed_from and __max_needed_from but this time for the destination character set.  It is crucial that these values be accurate since otherwise the conversion functions will have problems or not work at all.  
	int __stateful
This element must also be initialized by the init function. int __stateful is nonzero if the source character set is stateful. Otherwise it is zero.  
	void *__data
This element can be used freely by the conversion functions in the module.  void *__data can be used to communicate extra information from one call to another.  void *__data need not be initialized if not needed at all.  If void *__data element is assigned a pointer to dynamically allocated memory (presumably in the init function) it has to be made sure that the end function deallocates the memory.  Otherwise the application will leak memory.  It is important to be aware that this data structure is shared by all users of this specification conversion and therefore the __data element must not contain data specific to one specific use of the conversion function. 
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- Data type: struct __gconv_step_data
This is the data structure that contains the information specific to each use of the conversion functions. 
	char *__outbuf
	char *__outbufend
These elements specify the output buffer for the conversion step.  The __outbuf element points to the beginning of the buffer, and __outbufend points to the byte following the last byte in the buffer.  The conversion function must not assume anything about the size of the buffer but it can be safely assumed there is room for at least one complete character in the output buffer.  Once the conversion is finished, if the conversion is the last step, the __outbuf element must be modified to point after the last byte written into the buffer to signal how much output is available.  If this conversion step is not the last one, the element must not be modified. The __outbufend element must not be modified.  
	int __is_last
This element is nonzero if this conversion step is the last one.  This information is necessary for the recursion.  See the description of the conversion function internals below.  This element must never be modified.  
	int __invocation_counter
The conversion function can use this element to see how many calls of the conversion function already happened.  Some character sets require a certain prolog when generating output, and by comparing this value with zero, one can find out whether it is the first call and whether, therefore, the prolog should be emitted.  This element must never be modified.  
	int __internal_use
This element is another one rarely used but needed in certain situations.  It is assigned a nonzero value in case the conversion functions are used to implement mbsrtowcs et.al. (i.e., the function is not used directly through the iconv interface).  This sometimes makes a difference as it is expected that the iconv functions are used to translate entire texts while the mbsrtowcs functions are normally used only to convert single strings and might be used multiple times to convert entire texts.  But in this situation we would have problem complying with some rules of the character set specification.  Some character sets require a prolog, which must appear exactly once for an entire text.  If a number of mbsrtowcs calls are used to convert the text, only the first call must add the prolog.  However, because there is no communication between the different calls of mbsrtowcs, the conversion functions have no possibility to find this out.  The situation is different for sequences of iconv calls since the handle allows access to the needed information.  The int __internal_use element is mostly used together with __invocation_counter as follows:   if (!data->__internal_use      && data->__invocation_counter == 0)   /* Emit prolog.  */   …   This element must never be modified.  
	mbstate_t *__statep
The __statep element points to an object of type mbstate_t (see Keeping the state).  The conversion of a stateful character set must use the object pointed to by __statep to store information about the conversion state.  The __statep element itself must never be modified.  
	mbstate_t __state
This element must never be used directly.  It is only part of this structure to have the needed space allocated. 
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- gconv_init
The gconv_init function initializes the conversion function specific data structure.  This very same object is shared by all conversions that use this conversion and, therefore, no state information about the conversion itself must be stored in here.  If a module implements more than one conversion, the gconv_init function will be called multiple times. 
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- gconv_end
The gconv_end function is responsible for freeing all resources allocated by the gconv_init function.  If there is nothing to do, this function can be missing.  Special care must be taken if the module implements more than one conversion and the gconv_init function does not allocate the same resources for all conversions. 
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- gconv
This is the actual conversion function.  It is called to convert one block of text.  It gets passed the conversion step information initialized by gconv_init and the conversion data, specific to this use of the conversion functions. 
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- Data type: int (*__gconv_init_fct) (struct __gconv_step *)
This specifies the interface of the initialization function of the module.  It is called exactly once for each conversion the module implements. 
As explained in the description of the struct __gconv_step data structure above the initialization function has to initialize parts of it. 
	__min_needed_from
	__max_needed_from
	__min_needed_to
	__max_needed_to
These elements must be initialized to the exact numbers of the minimum and maximum number of bytes used by one character in the source and destination character sets, respectively.  If the characters all have the same size, the minimum and maximum values are the same.  
	__stateful
This element must be initialized to a nonzero value if the source character set is stateful.  Otherwise it must be zero. 
If the initialization function needs to communicate some information to the conversion function, this communication can happen using the __data element of the __gconv_step structure.  But since this data is shared by all the conversions, it must not be modified by the conversion function.  The example below shows how this can be used.

          new_data->dir = dir;
          new_data->var = var;
          step->__data = new_data;

          if (dir == from_iso2022jp)
            {
              step->__min_needed_from = MIN_NEEDED_FROM;
              step->__max_needed_from = MAX_NEEDED_FROM;
              step->__min_needed_to = MIN_NEEDED_TO;
              step->__max_needed_to = MAX_NEEDED_TO;
            }
          else
            {
              step->__min_needed_from = MIN_NEEDED_TO;
              step->__max_needed_from = MAX_NEEDED_TO;
              step->__min_needed_to = MIN_NEEDED_FROM;
              step->__max_needed_to = MAX_NEEDED_FROM + 2;
            }

          /* Yes, this is a stateful encoding.  */
          step->__stateful = 1;

          result = __GCONV_OK;
        }
    }

  return result;
}
EXAMPLE_END

The function first checks which conversion is wanted.  The module from which this function is taken implements four different conversions; which one is selected can be determined by comparing the names.  The comparison should always be done without paying attention to the case. 
Next, a data structure, which contains the necessary information about which conversion is selected, is allocated.  The data structure struct iso2022jp_data is locally defined since, outside the module, this data is not used at all.  Please note that if all four conversions this module supports are requested there are four data blocks. 
One interesting thing is the initialization of the __min_ and __max_ elements of the step data object.  A single ISO-2022-JP character can consist of one to four bytes.  Therefore the MIN_NEEDED_FROM and MAX_NEEDED_FROM macros are defined this way.  The output is always the INTERNAL character set (aka UCS-4) and therefore each character consists of exactly four bytes.  For the conversion from INTERNAL to ISO-2022-JP we have to take into account that escape sequences might be necessary to switch the character sets.  Therefore the __max_needed_to element for this direction gets assigned MAX_NEEDED_FROM + 2.  This takes into account the two bytes needed for the escape sequences to signal the switching.  The asymmetry in the maximum values for the two directions can be explained easily: when reading ISO-2022-JP text, escape sequences can be handled alone (i.e., it is not necessary to process a real character since the effect of the escape sequence can be recorded in the state information). The situation is different for the other direction.  Since it is in general not known which character comes next, one cannot emit escape sequences to change the state in advance.  This means the escape sequences have to be emitted together with the next character. Therefore one needs more room than only for the character itself. 
The possible return values of the initialization function are: 
	__GCONV_OK
The initialization succeeded 
	__GCONV_NOCONV
The requested conversion is not supported in the module.  This can happen if the gconv-modules file has errors. 
	__GCONV_NOMEM
Memory required to store additional information could not be allocated.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- Data type: void (*__gconv_end_fct) (struct gconv_step *)
The task of this function is to free all resources allocated in the initialization function.  Therefore only the __data element of the object pointed to by the argument is of interest.  Continuing the example from the initialization function, the finalization function looks like this: 

EXAMPLE_BEGIN
void
gconv_end (struct __gconv_step *data)
{
  free (data->__data);
}
EXAMPLE_END

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- Data type: int (*__gconv_fct) (struct __gconv_step *, struct __gconv_step_data *, const char **, const char *, size_t *, int)
The conversion function can be called for two basic reasons: to convert text or to reset the state.  From the description of the iconv function it can be seen why the flushing mode is necessary.  What mode is selected is determined by the sixth argument, an integer.  This argument being nonzero means that flushing is selected. 
Common to both modes is where the output buffer can be found.  The information about this buffer is stored in the conversion step data.  A pointer to this information is passed as the second argument to this function.  The description of the struct __gconv_step_data structure has more information on the conversion step data. 

What has to be done for flushing depends on the source character set. If the source character set is not stateful, nothing has to be done. Otherwise the function has to emit a byte sequence to bring the state object into the initial state.  Once this all happened the other conversion modules in the chain of conversions have to get the same chance.  Whether another step follows can be determined from the __is_last element of the step data structure to which the first parameter points. 
The more interesting mode is when actual text has to be converted.  The first step in this case is to convert as much text as possible from the input buffer and store the result in the output buffer.  The start of the input buffer is determined by the third argument, which is a pointer to a pointer variable referencing the beginning of the buffer.  The fourth argument is a pointer to the byte right after the last byte in the buffer. 
The conversion has to be performed according to the current state if the character set is stateful.  The state is stored in an object pointed to by the __statep element of the step data (second argument).  Once either the input buffer is empty or the output buffer is full the conversion stops.  At this point, the pointer variable referenced by the third parameter must point to the byte following the last processed byte (i.e., if all of the input is consumed, this pointer and the fourth parameter have the same value). 
What now happens depends on whether this step is the last one.  If it is the last step, the only thing that has to be done is to update the __outbuf element of the step data structure to point after the last written byte.  This update gives the caller the information on how much text is available in the output buffer.  In addition, the variable pointed to by the fifth parameter, which is of type size_t, must be incremented by the number of characters (not bytes) that were converted in a non-reversible way.  Then, the function can return. 
In case the step is not the last one, the later conversion functions have to get a chance to do their work.  Therefore, the appropriate conversion function has to be called.  The information about the functions is stored in the conversion data structures, passed as the first parameter. This information and the step data are stored in arrays, so the next element in both cases can be found by simple pointer arithmetic: 

EXAMPLE_BEGIN
int
gconv (struct __gconv_step *step, struct __gconv_step_data *data,
       const char **inbuf, const char *inbufend, size_t *written,
       int do_flush)
{
  struct __gconv_step *next_step = step + 1;
  struct __gconv_step_data *next_data = data + 1;
  …
EXAMPLE_END

The next_step pointer references the next step information and next_data the next data record.  The call of the next function therefore will look similar to this: 

EXAMPLE_BEGIN
  next_step->__fct (next_step, next_data, &outerr, outbuf,
                    written, 0)
EXAMPLE_END

But this is not yet all.  Once the function call returns the conversion function might have some more to do.  If the return value of the function is __GCONV_EMPTY_INPUT, more room is available in the output buffer.  Unless the input buffer is empty, the conversion functions start all over again and process the rest of the input buffer.  If the return value is not __GCONV_EMPTY_INPUT, something went wrong and we have to recover from this. 
A requirement for the conversion function is that the input buffer pointer (the third argument) always point to the last character that was put in converted form into the output buffer.  This is trivially true after the conversion performed in the current step, but if the conversion functions deeper downstream stop prematurely, not all characters from the output buffer are consumed and, therefore, the input buffer pointers must be backed off to the right position. 
Correcting the input buffers is easy to do if the input and output character sets have a fixed width for all characters.  In this situation we can compute how many characters are left in the output buffer and, therefore, can correct the input buffer pointer appropriately with a similar computation.  Things are getting tricky if either character set has characters represented with variable length byte sequences, and it gets even more complicated if the conversion has to take care of the state.  In these cases the conversion has to be performed once again, from the known state before the initial conversion (i.e., if necessary the state of the conversion has to be reset and the conversion loop has to be executed again).  The difference now is that it is known how much input must be created, and the conversion can stop before converting the first unused character.  Once this is done the input buffer pointers must be updated again and the function can return. 
One final thing should be mentioned.  If it is necessary for the conversion to know whether it is the first invocation (in case a prolog has to be emitted), the conversion function should increment the __invocation_counter element of the step data structure just before returning to the caller.  See the description of the struct __gconv_step_data structure above for more information on how this can be used. 
The return value must be one of the following values: 
	__GCONV_EMPTY_INPUT
All input was consumed and there is room left in the output buffer. 
	__GCONV_FULL_OUTPUT
No more room in the output buffer.  In case this is not the last step this value is propagated down from the call of the next conversion function in the chain. 
	__GCONV_INCOMPLETE_INPUT
The input buffer is not entirely empty since it contains an incomplete character sequence. 
The following example provides a framework for a conversion function. In case a new conversion has to be written the holes in this implementation have to be filled and that is it.
