The sa_flags member of the sigaction structure is a catch-all for special features.  Most of the time, SA_RESTART is a good value to use for this field. 
The value of sa_flags is interpreted as a bit mask.  Thus, you should choose the flags you want to set, OR those flags together, and store the result in the sa_flags member of your sigaction structure. 
Each signal number has its own set of flags.  Each call to sigaction affects one particular signal number, and the flags that you specify apply only to that particular signal. 
In the GNU C Library, establishing a handler with signal sets all the flags to zero except for SA_RESTART, whose value depends on the settings you have made with siginterrupt.  See Interrupted Primitives, to see what this is about. 
These macros are defined in the header file signal.h.
