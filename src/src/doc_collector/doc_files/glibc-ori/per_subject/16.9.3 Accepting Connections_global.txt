When a server receives a connection request, it can complete the connection by accepting the request.  Use the function accept to do this. 
A socket that has been established as a server can accept connection requests from multiple clients.  The server’s original socket does not become part of the connection; instead, accept makes a new socket which participates in the connection. accept returns the descriptor for this socket.  The server’s original socket remains available for listening for further connection requests. 
The number of pending connection requests on a server socket is finite. If connection requests arrive from clients faster than the server can act upon them, the queue can fill up and additional requests are refused with an ECONNREFUSED error.  You can specify the maximum length of this queue as an argument to the listen function, although the system may also impose its own internal limit on the length of this queue. 
The accept function is not allowed for sockets using connectionless communication styles.
