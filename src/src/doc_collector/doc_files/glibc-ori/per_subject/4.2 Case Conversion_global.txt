This section explains the library functions for performing conversions such as case mappings on characters.  For example, toupper converts any character to upper case if possible.  If the character can’t be converted, toupper returns it unchanged. 
These functions take one argument of type int, which is the character to convert, and return the converted character as an int.  If the conversion is not applicable to the argument given, the argument is returned unchanged. 
Compatibility Note: In pre-ISO C dialects, instead of returning the argument unchanged, these functions may fail when the argument is not suitable for the conversion.  Thus for portability, you may need to write islower(c) ? toupper(c) : c rather than just toupper(c). 
These functions are declared in the header file ctype.h.
