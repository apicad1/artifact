- Data Type: struct itimerval
This structure is used to specify when a timer should expire.  It contains the following members: 
	struct timeval it_interval
This is the period between successive timer interrupts.  If zero, the alarm will only be sent once.  
	struct timeval it_value
This is the period between now and the first timer interrupt.  If zero, the alarm is disabled. 
The struct timeval data type is described in Time Types.

- Function: int setitimer (int which, const struct itimerval *new, struct itimerval *old)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe timer | AS-Safe  | AC-Safe  | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
The setitimer function sets the timer specified by which according to new.  The which argument can have a value of ITIMER_REAL, ITIMER_VIRTUAL, or ITIMER_PROF. 
If old is not a null pointer, setitimer returns information about any previous unexpired timer of the same kind in the structure it points to. 
The return value is 0 on success and -1 on failure.  The following errno error conditions are defined for this function: 
	EINVAL
The timer period is too large.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- Function: int getitimer (int which, struct itimerval *old)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Safe  | AC-Safe  | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
The getitimer function stores information about the timer specified by which in the structure pointed at by old. 
The return value and error conditions are the same as for setitimer.

- ITIMER_REAL  
This constant can be used as the which argument to the setitimer and getitimer functions to specify the real-time timer.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- ITIMER_VIRTUAL  
This constant can be used as the which argument to the setitimer and getitimer functions to specify the virtual timer.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- ITIMER_PROF  
This constant can be used as the which argument to the setitimer and getitimer functions to specify the profiling timer.

- Function: unsigned int alarm (unsigned int seconds)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe timer | AS-Safe  | AC-Safe  | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
The alarm function sets the real-time timer to expire in seconds seconds.  If you want to cancel any existing alarm, you can do this by calling alarm with a seconds argument of zero. 
The return value indicates how many seconds remain before the previous alarm would have been sent.  If there was no previous alarm, alarm returns zero.
