Each obstack has an alignment boundary; each object allocated in the obstack automatically starts on an address that is a multiple of the specified boundary.  By default, this boundary is aligned so that the object can hold any type of data. 
To access an obstackâ€™s alignment boundary, use the macro obstack_alignment_mask, whose function prototype looks like this: 
Note that a change in alignment mask does not take effect until after the next time an object is allocated or finished in the obstack.  If you are not growing an object, you can make the new alignment mask take effect immediately by calling obstack_finish. This will finish a zero-length object and then do proper alignment for the next object.
