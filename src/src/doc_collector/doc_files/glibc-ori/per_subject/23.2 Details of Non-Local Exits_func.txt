- Data Type: jmp_buf
Objects of type jmp_buf hold the state information to be restored by a non-local exit.  The contents of a jmp_buf identify a specific place to return to.

- Macro: int setjmp (jmp_buf state)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Safe  | AC-Safe  | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
When called normally, setjmp stores information about the execution state of the program in state and returns zero.  If longjmp is later used to perform a non-local exit to this state, setjmp returns a nonzero value.

- Function: void longjmp (jmp_buf state, int value)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Unsafe plugin corrupt lock/hurd | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock/hurd | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
This function restores current execution to the state saved in state, and continues execution from the call to setjmp that established that return point.  Returning from setjmp by means of longjmp returns the value argument that was passed to longjmp, rather than 0.  (But if value is given as 0, setjmp returns 1).
