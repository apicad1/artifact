- Function: int obstack_room (struct obstack *obstack-ptr)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe race:obstack-ptr | AS-Safe  | AC-Safe  | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
This returns the number of bytes that can be added safely to the current growing object (or to an object about to be started) in obstack obstack-ptr using the fast growth functions.

- Function: void obstack_1grow_fast (struct obstack *obstack-ptr, char c)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe race:obstack-ptr | AS-Safe  | AC-Unsafe corrupt mem | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
The function obstack_1grow_fast adds one byte containing the character c to the growing object in obstack obstack-ptr.

- Function: void obstack_ptr_grow_fast (struct obstack *obstack-ptr, void *data)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe race:obstack-ptr | AS-Safe  | AC-Safe  | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
The function obstack_ptr_grow_fast adds sizeof (void *) bytes containing the value of data to the growing object in obstack obstack-ptr.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- Function: void obstack_int_grow_fast (struct obstack *obstack-ptr, int data)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe race:obstack-ptr | AS-Safe  | AC-Safe  | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
The function obstack_int_grow_fast adds sizeof (int) bytes containing the value of data to the growing object in obstack obstack-ptr.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- Function: void obstack_blank_fast (struct obstack *obstack-ptr, int size)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe race:obstack-ptr | AS-Safe  | AC-Safe  | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
The function obstack_blank_fast adds size bytes to the growing object in obstack obstack-ptr without initializing them.
