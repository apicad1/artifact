This section describes how to open a directory stream.  All the symbols are declared in the header file dirent.h. 
You shouldnâ€™t ever allocate objects of the struct dirent or DIR data types, since the directory access functions do that for you.  Instead, you refer to these objects using the pointers returned by the following functions. 
Directory streams are a high-level interface.  On Linux, alternative interfaces for accessing directories using file descriptors are available.  See Low-level Directory Access. 
The directory which is opened for reading by opendir is identified by the name.  In some situations this is not sufficient. Or the way opendir implicitly creates a file descriptor for the directory is not the way a program might want it.  In these cases an alternative interface can be used. 
In some situations it can be desirable to get hold of the file descriptor which is created by the opendir call.  For instance, to switch the current working directory to the directory just read the fchdir function could be used.  Historically the DIR type was exposed and programs could access the fields.  This does not happen in the GNU C Library.  Instead a separate function is provided to allow access.
