Opening a file with the fopen function creates a new stream and establishes a connection between the stream and a file.  This may involve creating a new file. 
Everything described in this section is declared in the header file stdio.h. 
You can have multiple streams (or file descriptors) pointing to the same file open at the same time.  If you do only input, this works straightforwardly, but you must be careful if any output streams are included.  See Stream/Descriptor Precautions.  This is equally true whether the streams are in one program (not usual) or in several programs (which can easily happen).  It may be advantageous to use the file locking facilities to avoid simultaneous access.  See File Locks. 
In some situations it is useful to know whether a given stream is available for reading or writing.  This information is normally not available and would have to be remembered separately.  Solaris introduced a few functions to get this information from the stream descriptor and these functions are also available in the GNU C Library. 
For slightly different kinds of problems there are two more functions. They provide even finer-grained information.
