You can use the ctermid function to get a file name that you can use to open the controlling terminal.  In the GNU C Library, it returns the same string all the time: "/dev/tty".  That is a special “magic” file name that refers to the controlling terminal of the current process (if it has one).  To find the name of the specific terminal device, use ttyname; see Is It a Terminal. 
The function ctermid is declared in the header file stdio.h.  
See also the isatty and ttyname functions, in Is It a Terminal.
