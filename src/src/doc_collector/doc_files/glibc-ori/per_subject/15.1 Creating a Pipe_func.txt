- Function: int pipe (int filedes[2])
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Safe  | AC-Safe fd | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
The pipe function creates a pipe and puts the file descriptors for the reading and writing ends of the pipe (respectively) into filedes[0] and filedes[1]. 
An easy way to remember that the input end comes first is that file descriptor 0 is standard input, and file descriptor 1 is standard output. 
If successful, pipe returns a value of 0.  On failure, -1 is returned.  The following errno error conditions are defined for this function: 
	EMFILE
The process has too many files open.  
	ENFILE
There are too many open files in the entire system.  See Error Codes, for more information about ENFILE.  This error never occurs on GNU/Hurd systems.
