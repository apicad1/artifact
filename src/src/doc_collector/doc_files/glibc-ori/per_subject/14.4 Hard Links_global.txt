In POSIX systems, one file can have many names at the same time.  All of the names are equally real, and no one of them is preferred to the others. 
To add a name to a file, use the link function.  (The new name is also called a hard link to the file.)  Creating a new link to a file does not copy the contents of the file; it simply makes a new name by which the file can be known, in addition to the fileâ€™s existing name or names. 
One file can have names in several directories, so the organization of the file system is not a strict hierarchy or tree. 
In most implementations, it is not possible to have hard links to the same file in multiple file systems.  link reports an error if you try to make a hard link to the file from another file system when this cannot be done. 
The prototype for the link function is declared in the header file unistd.h.
