The POSIX.1 standard specifies a number of parameters that describe the limitations of the file system.  It’s possible for the system to have a fixed, uniform limit for a parameter, but this isn’t the usual case.  On most systems, it’s possible for different file systems (and, for some parameters, even different files) to have different maximum limits.  For example, this is very likely if you use NFS to mount some of the file systems from other machines. 
Each of the following macros is defined in limits.h only if the system has a fixed, uniform limit for the parameter in question.  If the system allows different file systems or files to have different limits, then the macro is undefined; use pathconf or fpathconf to find out the limit that applies to a particular file.  See Pathconf. 
Each parameter also has another macro, with a name starting with ‘_POSIX’, which gives the lowest value that the limit is allowed to have on any POSIX system.  See File Minimums. 
These are alternative macro names for some of the same information.
