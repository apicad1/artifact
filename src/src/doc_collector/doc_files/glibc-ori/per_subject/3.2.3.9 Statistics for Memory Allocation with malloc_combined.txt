You can get information about dynamic memory allocation by calling the mallinfo2 function.  This function and its associated data type are declared in malloc.h; they are an extension of the standard SVID/XPG version.  

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- Data Type: struct mallinfo2
This structure type is used to return information about the dynamic memory allocator.  It contains the following members: 
	size_t arena
This is the total size of memory allocated with sbrk by malloc, in bytes.  
	size_t ordblks
This is the number of chunks not in use.  (The memory allocator size_ternally gets chunks of memory from the operating system, and then carves them up to satisfy individual malloc requests; see The GNU Allocator.)  
	size_t smblks
This field is unused.  
	size_t hblks
This is the total number of chunks allocated with mmap.  
	size_t hblkhd
This is the total size of memory allocated with mmap, in bytes.  
	size_t usmblks
This field is unused and always 0.  
	size_t fsmblks
This field is unused.  
	size_t uordblks
This is the total size of memory occupied by chunks handed out by malloc.  
	size_t fordblks
This is the total size of memory occupied by free (not in use) chunks.  
	size_t keepcost
This is the size of the top-most releasable chunk that normally borders the end of the heap (i.e., the high end of the virtual address spaceâ€™s data segment).
