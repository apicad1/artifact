This section describes the functions for mounting, unmounting, and remounting filesystems. 
Only the superuser can mount, unmount, or remount a filesystem. 
These functions do not access the fstab and mtab files.  You should maintain and use these separately.  See Mount Information. 
The symbols in this section are declared in sys/mount.h.
