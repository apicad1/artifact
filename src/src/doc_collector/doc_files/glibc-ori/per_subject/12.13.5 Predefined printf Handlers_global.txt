The GNU C Library also contains a concrete and useful application of the printf handler extension.  There are two functions available which implement a special way to print floating-point numbers. 
Due to the requirements of register_printf_function we must also provide the function which returns information about the arguments. 
To use these functions both functions must be registered with a call like 

EXAMPLE_BEGIN
register_printf_function ('B', printf_size, printf_size_info);
EXAMPLE_END

Here we register the functions to print numbers as powers of 1000 since the format character 'B' is an upper-case character.  If we would additionally use 'b' in a line like 

EXAMPLE_BEGIN
register_printf_function ('b', printf_size, printf_size_info);
EXAMPLE_END

we could also print using a power of 1024.  Please note that all that is different in these two lines is the format specifier.  The printf_size function knows about the difference between lower and upper case format specifiers. 
The use of 'B' and 'b' is no coincidence.  Rather it is the preferred way to use this functionality since it is available on some other systems which also use format specifiers.
