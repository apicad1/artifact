- Function: char * textdomain (const char *domainname)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Unsafe lock heap | AC-Unsafe lock mem | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
The textdomain function sets the default domain, which is used in all future gettext calls, to domainname.  Please note that dgettext and dcgettext calls are not influenced if the domainname parameter of these functions is not the null pointer. 
Before the first call to textdomain the default domain is messages.  This is the name specified in the specification of the gettext API.  This name is as good as any other name.  No program should ever really use a domain with this name since this can only lead to problems. 
The function returns the value which is from now on taken as the default domain.  If the system went out of memory the returned value is NULL and the global variable errno is set to ENOMEM. Despite the return value type being char * the return string must not be changed.  It is allocated internally by the textdomain function. 
If the domainname parameter is the null pointer no new default domain is set.  Instead the currently selected default domain is returned. 
If the domainname parameter is the empty string the default domain is reset to its initial value, the domain with the name messages. This possibility is questionable to use since the domain messages really never should be used.

- Function: char * bindtextdomain (const char *domainname, const char *dirname)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Unsafe heap | AC-Unsafe mem | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
The bindtextdomain function can be used to specify the directory which contains the message catalogs for domain domainname for the different languages.  To be correct, this is the directory where the hierarchy of directories is expected.  Details are explained below. 
For the programmer it is important to note that the translations which come with the program have to be placed in a directory hierarchy starting at, say, /foo/bar.  Then the program should make a bindtextdomain call to bind the domain for the current program to this directory.  So it is made sure the catalogs are found.  A correctly running program does not depend on the user setting an environment variable. 
The bindtextdomain function can be used several times and if the domainname argument is different the previously bound domains will not be overwritten. 
If the program which wish to use bindtextdomain at some point of time use the chdir function to change the current working directory it is important that the dirname strings ought to be an absolute pathname.  Otherwise the addressed directory might vary with the time. 
If the dirname parameter is the null pointer bindtextdomain returns the currently selected directory for the domain with the name domainname. 
The bindtextdomain function returns a pointer to a string containing the name of the selected directory name.  The string is allocated internally in the function and must not be changed by the user.  If the system went out of core during the execution of bindtextdomain the return value is NULL and the global variable errno is set accordingly.
