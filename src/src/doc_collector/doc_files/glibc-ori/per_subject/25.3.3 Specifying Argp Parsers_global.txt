The first argument to the argp_parse function is a pointer to a struct argp, which is known as an argp parser: 
Of the above group, options, parser, args_doc, and the doc fields are usually all that are needed.  If an argp parser is defined as an initialized C variable, only the fields used need be specified in the initializer.  The rest will default to zero due to the way C structure initialization works.  This design is exploited in most argp structures; the most-used fields are grouped near the beginning, the unused fields left unspecified.
