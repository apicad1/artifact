The C library provides functions to do basic operations on floating-point numbers.  These include absolute value, maximum and minimum, normalization, bit twiddling, rounding, and a few others. 

TABLE_BEGIN
 • Absolute Value    Absolute values of integers and floats.

 • Normalization Functions    Extracting exponents and putting them back.

 • Rounding Functions    Rounding floats to integers.

 • Remainder Functions    Remainders on division, precisely defined.

 • FP Bit Twiddling    Sign bit adjustment.  Adding epsilon.

 • FP Comparison Functions    Comparisons without risk of exceptions.

 • Misc FP Arithmetic    Max, min, positive difference, multiply-add.
