- Function: int getrusage (int processes, struct rusage *rusage)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Safe  | AC-Safe  | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
This function reports resource usage totals for processes specified by processes, storing the information in *rusage. 
In most systems, processes has only two valid values: 
	RUSAGE_SELF  
 Just the current process.  
	RUSAGE_CHILDREN  
 All child processes (direct and indirect) that have already terminated. 
The return value of getrusage is zero for success, and -1 for failure. 
	EINVAL
The argument processes is not valid.

- Data Type: struct rusage
This data type stores various resource usage statistics.  It has the following members, and possibly others: 
	struct timeval ru_utime
Time spent executing user instructions.  
	struct timeval ru_stime
Time spent in operating system code on behalf of processes.  
	long int ru_maxrss
The maximum resident set size used, in kilobytes.  That is, the maximum number of kilobytes of physical memory that processes used simultaneously.  
	long int ru_ixrss
An integral value expressed in kilobytes times ticks of execution, which indicates the amount of memory used by text that was shared with other processes.  
	long int ru_idrss
An integral value expressed the same way, which is the amount of unshared memory used for data.  
	long int ru_isrss
An integral value expressed the same way, which is the amount of unshared memory used for stack space.  
	long int ru_minflt
The number of page faults which were serviced without requiring any I/O.  
	long int ru_majflt
The number of page faults which were serviced by doing I/O.  
	long int ru_nswap
The number of times processes was swapped entirely out of main memory.  
	long int ru_inblock
The number of times the file system had to read from the disk on behalf of processes.  
	long int ru_oublock
The number of times the file system had to write to the disk on behalf of processes.  
	long int ru_msgsnd
Number of IPC messages sent.  
	long int ru_msgrcv
Number of IPC messages received.  
	long int ru_nsignals
Number of signals received.  
	long int ru_nvcsw
The number of times processes voluntarily invoked a context switch (usually to wait for some service).  
	long int ru_nivcsw
The number of times an involuntary context switch took place (because a time slice expired, or another process of higher priority was scheduled).
