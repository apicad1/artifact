These signals are all used to tell a process to terminate, in one way or another.  They have different names because theyâ€™re used for slightly different purposes, and programs might want to handle them differently. 
The reason for handling these signals is usually so your program can tidy up as appropriate before actually terminating.  For example, you might want to save state information, delete temporary files, or restore the previous terminal modes.  Such a handler should end by specifying the default action for the signal that happened and then reraising it; this will cause the program to terminate with that signal, as if it had not had a handler.  (See Termination in Handler.) 
The (obvious) default action for all of these signals is to cause the process to terminate.
