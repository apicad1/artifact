Certain other namespaces and associated protocol families are supported but not documented yet because they are not often used.  PF_NS refers to the Xerox Network Software protocols.  PF_ISO stands for Open Systems Interconnect.  PF_CCITT refers to protocols from CCITT.  socket.h defines these symbols and others naming protocols not actually implemented. 
PF_IMPLINK is used for communicating between hosts and Internet Message Processors.  For information on this and PF_ROUTE, an occasionally-used local area routing protocol, see the GNU Hurd Manual (to appear in the future).
