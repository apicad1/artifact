These functions, derived from BSD, are available in the separate libutil library, and declared in utmp.h.  
Note that the ut_user member of struct utmp is called ut_name in BSD.  Therefore, ut_name is defined as an alias for ut_user in utmp.h. 
Portability Note: The BSD struct utmp only has the ut_line, ut_name, ut_host and ut_time members.  Older systems do not even have the ut_host member.
