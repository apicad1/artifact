This section describes the various terminal attributes that control how input and output are done.  The functions, data structures, and symbolic constants are all declared in the header file termios.h. 
Don’t confuse terminal attributes with file attributes.  A device special file which is associated with a terminal has file attributes as described in File Attributes.  These are unrelated to the attributes of the terminal device itself, which are discussed in this section.
