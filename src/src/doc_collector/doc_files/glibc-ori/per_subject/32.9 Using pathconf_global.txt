When your machine allows different files to have different values for a file system parameter, you can use the functions in this section to find out the value that applies to any particular file. 
These functions and the associated constants for the parameter argument are declared in the header file unistd.h. 
Here are the symbolic constants that you can use as the parameter argument to pathconf and fpathconf.  The values are all integer constants. 
Portability Note: On some systems, the GNU C Library does not enforce _PC_NAME_MAX or _PC_PATH_MAX limits.
