You can find out which signals are pending at any time by calling sigpending.  This function is declared in signal.h.  

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- Function: int sigpending (sigset_t *set)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Unsafe lock/hurd | AC-Unsafe lock/hurd | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
The sigpending function stores information about pending signals in set.  If there is a pending signal that is blocked from delivery, then that signal is a member of the returned set.  (You can test whether a particular signal is a member of this set using sigismember; see Signal Sets.) 
The return value is 0 if successful, and -1 on failure. 
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Testing whether a signal is pending is not often useful.  Testing when that signal is not blocked is almost certainly bad design. 
Here is an example. 

EXAMPLE_BEGIN
#include <signal.h>
#include <stddef.h>

sigset_t base_mask, waiting_mask;

sigemptyset (&base_mask);
sigaddset (&base_mask, SIGINT);
sigaddset (&base_mask, SIGTSTP);

/* Block user interrupts while doing other processing. */
sigprocmask (SIG_SETMASK, &base_mask, NULL);
â€¦

/* After a while, check to see whether any signals are pending. */
sigpending (&waiting_mask);
if (sigismember (&waiting_mask, SIGINT)) {
  /* User has tried to kill the process. */
}
else if (sigismember (&waiting_mask, SIGTSTP)) {
  /* User has tried to stop the process. */
}
EXAMPLE_END

Remember that if there is a particular signal pending for your process, additional signals of that same type that arrive in the meantime might be discarded.  For example, if a SIGINT signal is pending when another SIGINT signal arrives, your program will probably only see one of them when you unblock this signal. 
Portability Note: The sigpending function is new in POSIX.1.  Older systems have no equivalent facility.
