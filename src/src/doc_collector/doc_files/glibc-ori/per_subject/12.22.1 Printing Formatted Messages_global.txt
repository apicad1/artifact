Messages can be printed to standard error and/or to the console.  To select the destination the programmer can use the following two values, bitwise OR combined if wanted, for the classification parameter of fmtmsg: 
The erroneous piece of the system can be signalled by exactly one of the following values which also is bitwise ORed with the classification parameter to fmtmsg: 
A third component of the classification parameter to fmtmsg can describe the part of the system which detects the problem.  This is done by using exactly one of the following values: 
A last component of classification can signal the results of this message.  Exactly one of the following values can be used: 
There are two environment variables which influence the behavior of fmtmsg.  The first is MSGVERB.  It is used to control the output actually happening on standard error (not the console output).  Each of the five fields can explicitly be enabled.  To do this the user has to put the MSGVERB variable with a format like the following in the environment before calling the fmtmsg function the first time: 

EXAMPLE_BEGIN
MSGVERB=keyword[:keyword[:…]]
EXAMPLE_END

Valid keywords are label, severity, text, action, and tag.  If the environment variable is not given or is the empty string, a not supported keyword is given or the value is somehow else invalid, no part of the message is masked out. 
The second environment variable which influences the behavior of fmtmsg is SEV_LEVEL.  This variable and the change in the behavior of fmtmsg is not specified in the X/Open Portability Guide.  It is available in System V systems, though.  It can be used to introduce new severity levels.  By default, only the five severity levels described above are available.  Any other numeric value would make fmtmsg print nothing. 
If the user puts SEV_LEVEL with a format like 

EXAMPLE_BEGIN
SEV_LEVEL=[description[:description[:…]]]
EXAMPLE_END

in the environment of the process before the first call to fmtmsg, where description has a value of the form 

EXAMPLE_BEGIN
severity-keyword,level,printstring
EXAMPLE_END

The severity-keyword part is not used by fmtmsg but it has to be present.  The level part is a string representation of a number.  The numeric value must be a number greater than 4.  This value must be used in the severity parameter of fmtmsg to select this class.  It is not possible to overwrite any of the predefined classes.  The printstring is the string printed when a message of this class is processed by fmtmsg (see above, fmtsmg does not print the numeric value but instead the string representation).
