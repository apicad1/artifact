Some of the facilities implemented by the C library really should be thought of as parts of the C language itself.  These facilities ought to be documented in the C Language Manual, not in the library manual; but since we don’t have the language manual yet, and documentation for these features has been written, we are publishing it here. 

TABLE_BEGIN
 • Consistency Checking    Using assert to abort if
				 something “impossible” happens.

                                 of args.

 • Null Pointer Constant    The macro NULL.

 • Important Data Types    Data types for object sizes.

 • Data Type Measurements    Parameters of data type representations.
