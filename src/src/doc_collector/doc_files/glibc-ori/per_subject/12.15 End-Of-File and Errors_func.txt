- Macro: int EOF
This macro is an integer value that is returned by a number of narrow stream functions to indicate an end-of-file condition, or some other error situation.  With the GNU C Library, EOF is -1.  In other libraries, its value may be some other negative number. 
This symbol is declared in stdio.h.

- Function: int feof (FILE *stream)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Safe  | AC-Unsafe lock | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
The feof function returns nonzero if and only if the end-of-file indicator for the stream stream is set. 
This symbol is declared in stdio.h.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- Function: int feof_unlocked (FILE *stream)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Safe  | AC-Safe  | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
The feof_unlocked function is equivalent to the feof function except that it does not implicitly lock the stream. 
This function is a GNU extension. 
This symbol is declared in stdio.h.

- Function: int ferror (FILE *stream)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Safe  | AC-Unsafe lock | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
The ferror function returns nonzero if and only if the error indicator for the stream stream is set, indicating that an error has occurred on a previous operation on the stream. 
This symbol is declared in stdio.h.

Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Safe  | AC-Safe  | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
The ferror_unlocked function is equivalent to the ferror function except that it does not implicitly lock the stream. 
This function is a GNU extension.
