In order to guarantee single access to a function, the GNU C Library implements a call once function to ensure a function is only called once in the presence of multiple, potentially calling threads.

- Data Type: once_flag
A complete object type capable of holding a flag used by call_once.

- Macro: ONCE_FLAG_INIT
This value is used to initialize an object of type once_flag.

- Function: void call_once (once_flag *flag, void (*func) (void))
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Safe  | AC-Safe  | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
call_once calls function func exactly once, even if invoked from several threads.  The completion of the function func synchronizes-with all previous or subsequent calls to call_once with the same flag variable.
