- Function: char * strfry (char *string)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Safe  | AC-Safe  | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
strfry performs an in-place shuffle on string.  Each character is swapped to a position selected at random, within the portion of the string starting with the characterâ€™s original position. (This is the Fisher-Yates algorithm for unbiased shuffling.) 
Calling strfry will not disturb any of the random number generators that have global state (see Pseudo-Random Numbers). 
The return value of strfry is always string. 
Portability Note:  This function is unique to the GNU C Library. It is declared in string.h.
