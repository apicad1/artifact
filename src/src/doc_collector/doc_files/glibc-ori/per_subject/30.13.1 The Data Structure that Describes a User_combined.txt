The functions and data structures for accessing the system user database are declared in the header file pwd.h.  

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- Data Type: struct passwd
The passwd data structure is used to hold information about entries in the system user data base.  It has at least the following members: 
	char *pw_name
The user’s login name.  
	char *pw_passwd
Historically, this field would hold the one-way hash of the user’s passphrase.  Nowadays, it will almost always be the single character ‘x’, indicating that the hash is in the shadow database.  
	uid_t pw_uid
The user ID number.  
	gid_t pw_gid
The user’s default group ID number.  
	char *pw_gecos
A string typically containing the user’s real name, and possibly other information such as a phone number.  
	char *pw_dir
The user’s home directory, or initial working directory.  This might be a null pointer, in which case the interpretation is system-dependent.  
	char *pw_shell
The user’s default shell, or the initial program run when the user logs in. This might be a null pointer, indicating that the system default should be used.
