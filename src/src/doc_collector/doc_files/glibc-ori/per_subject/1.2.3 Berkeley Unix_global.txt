The GNU C Library defines facilities from some versions of Unix which are not formally standardized, specifically from the 4.2 BSD, 4.3 BSD, and 4.4 BSD Unix systems (also known as Berkeley Unix) and from SunOS (a popular 4.2 BSD derivative that includes some Unix System V functionality).  These systems support most of the ISOÂ C and POSIX facilities, and 4.4 BSD and newer releases of SunOS in fact support them all. 
The BSD facilities include symbolic links (see Symbolic Links), the select function (see Waiting for I/O), the BSD signal functions (see BSD Signal Handling), and sockets (see Sockets).
