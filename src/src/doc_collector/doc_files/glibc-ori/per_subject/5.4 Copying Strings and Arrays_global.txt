You can use the functions described in this section to copy the contents of strings, wide strings, and arrays.  The ‘str’ and ‘mem’ functions are declared in string.h while the ‘w’ functions are declared in wchar.h.        
A helpful way to remember the ordering of the arguments to the functions in this section is that it corresponds to an assignment expression, with the destination array specified to the left of the source array.  Most of these functions return the address of the destination array; a few return the address of the destination’s terminating null, or of just past the destination. 
Most of these functions do not work properly if the source and destination arrays overlap.  For example, if the beginning of the destination array overlaps the end of the source array, the original contents of that part of the source array may get overwritten before it is copied.  Even worse, in the case of the string functions, the null byte marking the end of the string may be lost, and the copy function might get stuck in a loop trashing all the memory allocated to your program. 
All functions that have problems copying between overlapping arrays are explicitly identified in this manual.  In addition to functions in this section, there are a few others like sprintf (see Formatted Output Functions) and scanf (see Formatted Input Functions).
