- Macro: int F_GETFD
This macro is used as the command argument to fcntl, to specify that it should return the file descriptor flags associated with the filedes argument. 
The normal return value from fcntl with this command is a nonnegative number which can be interpreted as the bitwise OR of the individual flags (except that currently there is only one flag to use). 
In case of an error, fcntl returns -1.  The following errno error conditions are defined for this command: 
	EBADF
The filedes argument is invalid.

- Macro: int F_SETFD
This macro is used as the command argument to fcntl, to specify that it should set the file descriptor flags associated with the filedes argument.  This requires a third int argument to specify the new flags, so the form of the call is: 

EXAMPLE_BEGIN
fcntl (filedes, F_SETFD, new-flags)
EXAMPLE_END

The normal return value from fcntl with this command is an unspecified value other than -1, which indicates an error. The flags and error conditions are the same as for the F_GETFD command.

- Macro: int FD_CLOEXEC

This flag specifies that the file descriptor should be closed when an exec function is invoked; see Executing a File.  When a file descriptor is allocated (as with open or dup), this bit is initially cleared on the new file descriptor, meaning that descriptor will survive into the new program after exec.
