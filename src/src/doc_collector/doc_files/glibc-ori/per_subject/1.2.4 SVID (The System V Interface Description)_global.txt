The System V Interface Description (SVID) is a document describing the AT&T Unix System V operating system.  It is to some extent a superset of the POSIX standard (see POSIX). 
The GNU C Library defines most of the facilities required by the SVID that are not also required by the ISOÂ C or POSIX standards, for compatibility with  System V Unix and other Unix systems (such as SunOS) which include these facilities.  However, many of the more obscure and less generally useful facilities required by the SVID are not included.  (In fact, Unix System V itself does not provide them all.) 
The supported facilities from System V include the methods for inter-process communication and shared memory, the hsearch and drand48 families of functions, fmtmsg and several of the mathematical functions.
