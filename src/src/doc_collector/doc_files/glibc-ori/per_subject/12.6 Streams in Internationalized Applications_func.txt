- Function: int fwide (FILE *stream, int mode)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Unsafe corrupt | AC-Unsafe lock | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
The fwide function can be used to set and query the state of the orientation of the stream stream.  If the mode parameter has a positive value the streams get wide oriented, for negative values narrow oriented.  It is not possible to overwrite previous orientations with fwide.  I.e., if the stream stream was already oriented before the call nothing is done. 
If mode is zero the current orientation state is queried and nothing is changed. 
The fwide function returns a negative value, zero, or a positive value if the stream is narrow, not at all, or wide oriented respectively. 
This function was introduced in Amendment 1 to ISO C90 and is declared in wchar.h.
