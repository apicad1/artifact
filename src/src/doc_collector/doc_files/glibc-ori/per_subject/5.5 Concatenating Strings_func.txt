- Function: char * strcat (char *restrict to, const char *restrict from)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Safe  | AC-Safe  | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
The strcat function is similar to strcpy, except that the bytes from from are concatenated or appended to the end of to, instead of overwriting it.  That is, the first byte from from overwrites the null byte marking the end of to. 
An equivalent definition for strcat would be: 

EXAMPLE_BEGIN
char *
strcat (char *restrict to, const char *restrict from)
{
  strcpy (to + strlen (to), from);
  return to;
}
EXAMPLE_END

This function has undefined results if the strings overlap. 
As noted below, this function has significant performance issues.

- Function: wchar_t * wcscat (wchar_t *restrict wto, const wchar_t *restrict wfrom)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Safe  | AC-Safe  | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
The wcscat function is similar to wcscpy, except that the wide characters from wfrom are concatenated or appended to the end of wto, instead of overwriting it.  That is, the first wide character from wfrom overwrites the null wide character marking the end of wto. 
An equivalent definition for wcscat would be: 

EXAMPLE_BEGIN
wchar_t *
wcscat (wchar_t *wto, const wchar_t *wfrom)
{
  wcscpy (wto + wcslen (wto), wfrom);
  return wto;
}
EXAMPLE_END
