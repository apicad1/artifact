- Data Type: div_t
This is a structure type used to hold the result returned by the div function.  It has the following members: 
	int quot
The quotient from the division.  
	int rem
The remainder from the division.

- Function: div_t div (int numerator, int denominator)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Safe  | AC-Safe  | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
The function div computes the quotient and remainder from the division of numerator by denominator, returning the result in a structure of type div_t. 
If the result cannot be represented (as in a division by zero), the behavior is undefined. 
Here is an example, albeit not a very useful one. 

EXAMPLE_BEGIN
div_t result;
result = div (20, -6);
EXAMPLE_END

Now result.quot is -3 and result.rem is 2.

- Data Type: ldiv_t
This is a structure type used to hold the result returned by the ldiv function.  It has the following members: 
	long int quot
The quotient from the division.  
	long int rem
The remainder from the division. 
(This is identical to div_t except that the components are of type long int rather than int.)

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- Function: ldiv_t ldiv (long int numerator, long int denominator)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Safe  | AC-Safe  | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
The ldiv function is similar to div, except that the arguments are of type long int and the result is returned as a structure of type ldiv_t.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- Data Type: lldiv_t
This is a structure type used to hold the result returned by the lldiv function.  It has the following members: 
	long long int quot
The quotient from the division.  
	long long int rem
The remainder from the division. 
(This is identical to div_t except that the components are of type long long int rather than int.) 
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- Function: lldiv_t lldiv (long long int numerator, long long int denominator)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Safe  | AC-Safe  | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
The lldiv function is like the div function, but the arguments are of type long long int and the result is returned as a structure of type lldiv_t. 
The lldiv function was added in ISO C99.

- Data Type: imaxdiv_t
This is a structure type used to hold the result returned by the imaxdiv function.  It has the following members: 
	intmax_t quot
The quotient from the division.  
	intmax_t rem
The remainder from the division. 
(This is identical to div_t except that the components are of type intmax_t rather than int.) 
See Integers for a description of the intmax_t type.

- Function: imaxdiv_t imaxdiv (intmax_t numerator, intmax_t denominator)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Safe  | AC-Safe  | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
The imaxdiv function is like the div function, but the arguments are of type intmax_t and the result is returned as a structure of type imaxdiv_t. 
See Integers for a description of the intmax_t type. 
The imaxdiv function was added in ISO C99.
