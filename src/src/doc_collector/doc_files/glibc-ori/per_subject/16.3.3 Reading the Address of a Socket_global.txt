Use the function getsockname to examine the address of an Internet socket.  The prototype for this function is in the header file sys/socket.h. 
You can’t read the address of a socket in the file namespace.  This is consistent with the rest of the system; in general, there’s no way to find a file’s name from a descriptor for that file.
