- Function: int dup (int old)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Safe  | AC-Safe  | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
This function copies descriptor old to the first available descriptor number (the first number not currently open).  It is equivalent to fcntl (old, F_DUPFD, 0).

- Function: int dup2 (int old, int new)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Safe  | AC-Safe  | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
This function copies the descriptor old to descriptor number new. 
If old is an invalid descriptor, then dup2 does nothing; it does not close new.  Otherwise, the new duplicate of old replaces any previous meaning of descriptor new, as if new were closed first. 
If old and new are different numbers, and old is a valid descriptor number, then dup2 is equivalent to: 

EXAMPLE_BEGIN
close (new);
fcntl (old, F_DUPFD, new)
EXAMPLE_END

However, dup2 does this atomically; there is no instant in the middle of calling dup2 at which new is closed and not yet a duplicate of old.

- Macro: int F_DUPFD
This macro is used as the command argument to fcntl, to copy the file descriptor given as the first argument. 
The form of the call in this case is: 

EXAMPLE_BEGIN
fcntl (old, F_DUPFD, next-filedes)
EXAMPLE_END

The next-filedes argument is of type int and specifies that the file descriptor returned should be the next available one greater than or equal to this value. 
The return value from fcntl with this command is normally the value of the new file descriptor.  A return value of -1 indicates an error.  The following errno error conditions are defined for this command: 
	EBADF
The old argument is invalid.  
	EINVAL
The next-filedes argument is invalid.  
	EMFILE
There are no more file descriptors availableâ€”your program is already using the maximum.  In BSD and GNU, the maximum is controlled by a resource limit that can be changed; see Limits on Resources, for more information about the RLIMIT_NOFILE limit. 
ENFILE is not a possible error code for dup2 because dup2 does not create a new opening of a file; duplicate descriptors do not count toward the limit which ENFILE indicates.  EMFILE is possible because it refers to the limit on distinct descriptor numbers in use in one process.
