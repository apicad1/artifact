Some non GUI programs ask a yes-or-no question.  If the messages (especially the questions) are translated into foreign languages, be sure that you localize the answers too.  It would be very bad habit to ask a question in one language and request the answer in another, often English. 
The GNU C Library contains rpmatch to give applications easy access to the corresponding locale definitions. 
This function would normally be used like this: 

EXAMPLE_BEGIN
  â€¦
  /* Use a safe default.  */
  _Bool doit = false;

  fputs (gettext ("Do you really want to do this? "), stdout);
  fflush (stdout);
  /* Prepare the getline call.  */
  line = NULL;
  len = 0;
  while (getline (&line, &len, stdin) >= 0)
    {
      /* Check the response.  */
      int res = rpmatch (line);
      if (res >= 0)
        {
          /* We got a definitive answer.  */
          if (res > 0)
            doit = true;
          break;
        }
    }
  /* Free what getline allocated.  */
  free (line);
EXAMPLE_END

Note that the loop continues until a read error is detected or until a definitive (positive or negative) answer is read.
