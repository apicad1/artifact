The classification functions are also generalized by the ISO C standard.  Instead of just allowing the two standard mappings, a locale can contain others.  Again, the localedef program already supports generating such locale data files. 
For the generally available mappings, the ISO C standard defines convenient shortcuts so that it is not necessary to call wctrans for them. 
The same warnings given in the last section for the use of the wide character classification functions apply here.  It is not possible to simply cast a char type value to a wint_t and use it as an argument to towctrans calls.
