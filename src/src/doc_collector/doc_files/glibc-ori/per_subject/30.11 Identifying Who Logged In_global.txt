You can use the functions listed in this section to determine the login name of the user who is running a process, and the name of the user who logged in the current session.  See also the function getuid and friends (see Reading Persona).  How this information is collected by the system and how to control/add/remove information from the background storage is described in User Accounting Database. 
The getlogin function is declared in unistd.h, while cuserid and L_cuserid are declared in stdio.h.   
These functions let your program identify positively the user who is running or the user who logged in this session.  (These can differ when setuid programs are involved; see Process Persona.)  The user cannot do anything to fool these functions. 
For most purposes, it is more useful to use the environment variable LOGNAME to find out who the user is.  This is more flexible precisely because the user can set LOGNAME arbitrarily. See Standard Environment.
