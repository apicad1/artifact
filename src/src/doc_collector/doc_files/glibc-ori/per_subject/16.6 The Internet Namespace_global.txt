This section describes the details of the protocols and socket naming conventions used in the Internet namespace. 
Originally the Internet namespace used only IP version 4 (IPv4).  With the growing number of hosts on the Internet, a new protocol with a larger address space was necessary: IP version 6 (IPv6).  IPv6 introduces 128-bit addresses (IPv4 has 32-bit addresses) and other features, and will eventually replace IPv4. 
To create a socket in the IPv4 Internet namespace, use the symbolic name PF_INET of this namespace as the namespace argument to socket or socketpair.  For IPv6 addresses you need the macro PF_INET6.  These macros are defined in sys/socket.h.  
A socket address for the Internet namespace includes the following components: 
  The address of the machine you want to connect to.  Internet addresses can be specified in several ways; these are discussed in Internet Address Formats, Host Addresses and Host Names.   A port number for that machine.  See Ports. 
You must ensure that the address and port number are represented in a canonical format called network byte order.  See Byte Order, for information about this. 

TABLE_BEGIN
 • Internet Address Formats    How socket addresses are specified in the
                                 Internet namespace.

 • Host Addresses    All about host addresses of Internet host.

 • Ports    Internet port numbers.

 • Services Database    Ports may have symbolic names.

 • Byte Order    Different hosts may use different byte
                                 ordering conventions; you need to
                                 canonicalize host address and port number.

 • Protocols Database    Referring to protocols by name.

 • Inet Example    Putting it all together.
