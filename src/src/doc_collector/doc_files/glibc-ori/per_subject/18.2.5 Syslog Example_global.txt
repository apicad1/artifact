Here is an example of openlog, syslog, and closelog: 
This example sets the logmask so that debug and informational messages get discarded without ever reaching Syslog.  So the second syslog in the example does nothing. 

EXAMPLE_BEGIN
#include <syslog.h>

setlogmask (LOG_UPTO (LOG_NOTICE));

openlog ("exampleprog", LOG_CONS | LOG_PID | LOG_NDELAY, LOG_LOCAL1);

syslog (LOG_NOTICE, "Program started by User %d", getuid ());
syslog (LOG_INFO, "A tree falls in a forest");

closelog ();

EXAMPLE_END
