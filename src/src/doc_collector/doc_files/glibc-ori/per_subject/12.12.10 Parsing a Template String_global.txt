You can use the function parse_printf_format to obtain information about the number and types of arguments that are expected by a given template string.  This function permits interpreters that provide interfaces to printf to avoid passing along invalid arguments from the userâ€™s program, which could cause a crash. 
All the symbols described in this section are declared in the header file printf.h. 
The argument types are encoded as a combination of a basic type and modifier flag bits. 
Here are symbolic constants that represent the basic types; they stand for integer values. 
Here are the flag bits that modify a basic type.  They are combined with the code for the basic type using inclusive-or.
