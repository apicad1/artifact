- Data Type: ptrdiff_t
This is the signed integer type of the result of subtracting two pointers.  For example, with the declaration char *p1, *p2;, the expression p2 - p1 is of type ptrdiff_t.  This will probably be one of the standard signed integer types (short int, int or long int), but might be a nonstandard type that exists only for this purpose.

- Data Type: size_t
This is an unsigned integer type used to represent the sizes of objects. The result of the sizeof operator is of this type, and functions such as malloc (see Unconstrained Allocation) and memcpy (see Copying Strings and Arrays) accept arguments of this type to specify object sizes.  On systems using the GNU C Library, this will be unsigned int or unsigned long int. 
Usage Note: size_t is the preferred way to declare any arguments or variables that hold the size of an object.
