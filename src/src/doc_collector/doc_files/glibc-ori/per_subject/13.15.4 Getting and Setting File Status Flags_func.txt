- Macro: int F_GETFL
This macro is used as the command argument to fcntl, to read the file status flags for the open file with descriptor filedes. 
The normal return value from fcntl with this command is a nonnegative number which can be interpreted as the bitwise OR of the individual flags.  Since the file access modes are not single-bit values, you can mask off other bits in the returned flags with O_ACCMODE to compare them. 
In case of an error, fcntl returns -1.  The following errno error conditions are defined for this command: 
	EBADF
The filedes argument is invalid.

- Macro: int F_SETFL
This macro is used as the command argument to fcntl, to set the file status flags for the open file corresponding to the filedes argument.  This command requires a third int argument to specify the new flags, so the call looks like this: 

EXAMPLE_BEGIN
fcntl (filedes, F_SETFL, new-flags)
EXAMPLE_END

You canâ€™t change the access mode for the file in this way; that is, whether the file descriptor was opened for reading or writing. 
The normal return value from fcntl with this command is an unspecified value other than -1, which indicates an error.  The error conditions are the same as for the F_GETFL command.
