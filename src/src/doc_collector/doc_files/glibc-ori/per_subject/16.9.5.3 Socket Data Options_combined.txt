The flags argument to send and recv is a bit mask.  You can bitwise-OR the values of the following macros together to obtain a value for this argument.  All are defined in the header file sys/socket.h. 

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- Macro: int MSG_OOB
Send or receive out-of-band data.  See Out-of-Band Data. 
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- Macro: int MSG_PEEK
Look at the data but don’t remove it from the input queue.  This is only meaningful with input functions such as recv, not with send. 
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- Macro: int MSG_DONTROUTE
Don’t include routing information in the message.  This is only meaningful with output operations, and is usually only of interest for diagnostic or routing programs.  We don’t try to explain it here.
