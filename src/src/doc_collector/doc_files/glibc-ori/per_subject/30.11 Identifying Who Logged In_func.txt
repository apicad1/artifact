- Function: char * getlogin (void)
Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:getlogin race:utent sig:ALRM timer locale | AS-Unsafe dlopen plugin heap lock | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock fd mem | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
The getlogin function returns a pointer to a string containing the name of the user logged in on the controlling terminal of the process, or a null pointer if this information cannot be determined.  The string is statically allocated and might be overwritten on subsequent calls to this function or to cuserid.

- Function: char * cuserid (char *string)
Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:cuserid/!string locale | AS-Unsafe dlopen plugin heap lock | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock fd mem | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
The cuserid function returns a pointer to a string containing a user name associated with the effective ID of the process.  If string is not a null pointer, it should be an array that can hold at least L_cuserid characters; the string is returned in this array.  Otherwise, a pointer to a string in a static area is returned. This string is statically allocated and might be overwritten on subsequent calls to this function or to getlogin. 
The use of this function is deprecated since it is marked to be withdrawn in XPG4.2 and has already been removed from newer revisions of POSIX.1.
