Here are descriptions of the macros used to retrieve variable arguments. These macros are defined in the header file stdarg.h.  
Sometimes it is necessary to parse the list of parameters more than once or one wants to remember a certain position in the parameter list.  To do this, one will have to make a copy of the current value of the argument.  But va_list is an opaque type and one cannot necessarily assign the value of one variable of type va_list to another variable of the same type. 
If you want to use va_copy and be portable to pre-C99 systems, you should always be prepared for the possibility that this macro will not be available.  On architectures where a simple assignment is invalid, hopefully va_copy will be available, so one should always write something like this if concerned about pre-C99 portability: 

EXAMPLE_BEGIN
{
  va_list ap, save;
  …
#ifdef va_copy
  va_copy (save, ap);
#else
  save = ap;
#endif
  …
}
EXAMPLE_END
