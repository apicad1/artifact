The GNU C Library provides pattern matching facilities for two kinds of patterns: regular expressions and file-name wildcards.  The library also provides a facility for expanding variable and command references and parsing text into words in the way the shell does. 

TABLE_BEGIN
 • Wildcard Matching    Matching a wildcard pattern against a single string.

 • Globbing    Finding the files that match a wildcard pattern.

 • Regular Expressions    Matching regular expressions against strings.

 • Word Expansion    Expanding shell variables, nested commands,
			    arithmetic, and wildcards.
			    This is what the shell does with shell commands.
