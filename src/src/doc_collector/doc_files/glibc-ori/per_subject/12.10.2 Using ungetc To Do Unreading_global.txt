The function to unread a character is called ungetc, because it reverses the action of getc. 
Here is an example showing the use of getc and ungetc to skip over whitespace characters.  When this function reaches a non-whitespace character, it unreads that character to be seen again on the next read operation on the stream. 

EXAMPLE_BEGIN
#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>

void
skip_whitespace (FILE *stream)
{
  int c;
  do
    /* No need to check for EOF because it is not
       isspace, and ungetc ignores EOF.  */
    c = getc (stream);
  while (isspace (c));
  ungetc (c, stream);
}
