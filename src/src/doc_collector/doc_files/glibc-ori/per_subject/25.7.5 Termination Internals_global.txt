The _exit function is the primitive used for process termination by exit.  It is declared in the header file unistd.h.  
When a process terminates for any reason—either because the program terminates, or as a result of a signal—the following things happen: 
  All open file descriptors in the process are closed.  See Low-Level I/O. Note that streams are not flushed automatically when the process terminates; see I/O on Streams.   A process exit status is saved to be reported back to the parent process via wait or waitpid; see Process Completion.  If the program exited, this status includes as its low-order 8 bits the program exit status.    Any child processes of the process being terminated are assigned a new parent process.  (On most systems, including GNU, this is the init process, with process ID 1.)   A SIGCHLD signal is sent to the parent process.   If the process is a session leader that has a controlling terminal, then a SIGHUP signal is sent to each process in the foreground job, and the controlling terminal is disassociated from that session. See Job Control.   If termination of a process causes a process group to become orphaned, and any member of that process group is stopped, then a SIGHUP signal and a SIGCONT signal are sent to each process in the group.  See Job Control.
