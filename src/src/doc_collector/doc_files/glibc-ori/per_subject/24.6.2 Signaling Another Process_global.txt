The kill function can be used to send a signal to another process. In spite of its name, it can be used for a lot of things other than causing a process to terminate.  Some examples of situations where you might want to send signals between processes are: 
  A parent process starts a child to perform a task—perhaps having the child running an infinite loop—and then terminates the child when the task is no longer needed.   A process executes as part of a group, and needs to terminate or notify the other processes in the group when an error or other event occurs.   Two processes need to synchronize while working together. 
This section assumes that you know a little bit about how processes work.  For more information on this subject, see Processes. 
The kill function is declared in signal.h.  
As a simple example of kill, the call kill (getpid (), sig) has the same effect as raise (sig).
