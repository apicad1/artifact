All the functions, constants and data types for word expansion are declared in the header file wordexp.h. 
Word expansion produces a vector of words (strings).  To return this vector, wordexp uses a special data type, wordexp_t, which is a structure.  You pass wordexp the address of the structure, and it fills in the structureâ€™s fields to tell you about the results.
