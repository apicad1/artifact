This chapter contains information about functions for doing basic arithmetic operations, such as splitting a float into its integer and fractional parts or retrieving the imaginary part of a complex value. These functions are declared in the header files math.h and complex.h.

 • Integers    Basic integer types and concepts

 • Integer Division    Integer division with guaranteed rounding.

 • Floating Point Numbers    Basic concepts.  IEEE 754.

 • Floating Point Classes    The five kinds of floating-point number.

 • Floating Point Errors    When something goes wrong in a calculation.

 • Rounding    Controlling how results are rounded.

 • Control Functions    Saving and restoring the FPU’s state.

 • Arithmetic Functions    Fundamental operations provided by the library.

 • Complex Numbers    The types.  Writing complex constants.

 • Operations on Complex    Projection, conjugation, decomposition.

 • Parsing of Numbers    Converting strings to numbers.

 • Printing of Floats    Converting floating-point numbers to strings.
