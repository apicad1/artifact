This section describes the functions for altering the group IDs (real and effective) of a process.  To use these facilities, you must include the header files sys/types.h and unistd.h.   
setuid and setgid behave differently depending on whether the effective user ID at the time is zero.  If it is not zero, they behave like seteuid and setegid.  If it is, they change both effective and real IDs and delete the file ID.  To avoid confusion, we recommend you always use seteuid and setegid except when you know the effective user ID is zero and your intent is to change the persona permanently.  This case is rare—most of the programs that need it, such as login and su, have already been written. 
Note that if your program is setuid to some user other than root, there is no way to drop privileges permanently. 
The system also lets privileged processes change their supplementary group IDs.  To use setgroups or initgroups, your programs should include the header file grp.h.  
If you are interested in the groups a particular user belongs to, but do not want to change the process’s supplementary group IDs, you can use getgrouplist.  To use getgrouplist, your programs should include the header file grp.h.
