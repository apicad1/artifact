>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- generic
As described above (see Porting), this is the subdirectory that every configuration implicitly uses after all others. 
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- ieee754
This directory is for code using the IEEE 754 floating-point format, where the C type float is IEEE 754 single-precision format, and double is IEEE 754 double-precision format.  Usually this directory is referred to in the Implies file in a machine architecture-specific directory, such as m68k/Implies. 
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- libm-ieee754
This directory contains an implementation of a mathematical library usable on platforms which use IEEEÂ 754 conformant floating-point arithmetic. 
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- libm-i387
This is a special case.  Ideally the code should be in sysdeps/i386/fpu but for various reasons it is kept aside. 
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- posix
This directory contains implementations of things in the library in terms of POSIX.1 functions.  This includes some of the POSIX.1 functions themselves.  Of course, POSIX.1 cannot be completely implemented in terms of itself, so a configuration using just posix cannot be complete. 
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- unix
This is the directory for Unix-like things.  See Porting to Unix. unix implies posix.  There are some special-purpose subdirectories of unix: 
	unix/common
This directory is for things common to both BSD and System V release 4. Both unix/bsd and unix/sysv/sysv4 imply unix/common.  
	unix/inet
This directory is for socket and related functions on Unix systems. unix/inet/Subdirs enables the inet top-level subdirectory. unix/common implies unix/inet. 
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- mach
This is the directory for things based on the Mach microkernel from CMU (including GNU/Hurd systems).  Other basic operating systems (VMS, for example) would have their own directories at the top level of the sysdeps hierarchy, parallel to unix and mach.
