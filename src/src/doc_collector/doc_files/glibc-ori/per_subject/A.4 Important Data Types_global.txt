The result of subtracting two pointers in C is always an integer, but the precise data type varies from C compiler to C compiler.  Likewise, the data type of the result of sizeof also varies between compilers. ISO C defines standard aliases for these two types, so you can refer to them in a portable fashion.  They are defined in the header file stddef.h.  
Compatibility Note: Implementations of C before the advent of ISOÂ C generally used unsigned int for representing object sizes and int for pointer subtraction results.  They did not necessarily define either size_t or ptrdiff_t.  Unix systems did define size_t, in sys/types.h, but the definition was usually a signed type.
