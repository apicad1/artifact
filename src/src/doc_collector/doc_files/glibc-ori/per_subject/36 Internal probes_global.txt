In order to aid in debugging and monitoring internal behavior, the GNU C Library exposes nearly-zero-overhead SystemTap probes marked with the libc provider. 
These probes are not part of the GNU C Library stable ABI, and they are subject to change or removal across releases.  Our only promise with regard to them is that, if we find a need to remove or modify the arguments of a probe, the modified probe will have a different name, so that program monitors relying on the old probe will not get unexpected arguments.
