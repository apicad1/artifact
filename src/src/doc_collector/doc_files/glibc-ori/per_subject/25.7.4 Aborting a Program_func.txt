- Function: void abort (void)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Unsafe corrupt | AC-Unsafe lock corrupt | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
The abort function causes abnormal program termination.  This does not execute cleanup functions registered with atexit or on_exit. 
This function actually terminates the process by raising a SIGABRT signal, and your program can include a handler to intercept this signal; see Signal Handling.
