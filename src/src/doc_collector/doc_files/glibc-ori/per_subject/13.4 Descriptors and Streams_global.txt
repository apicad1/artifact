Given an open file descriptor, you can create a stream for it with the fdopen function.  You can get the underlying file descriptor for an existing stream with the fileno function.  These functions are declared in the header file stdio.h.  
For an example showing the use of the fdopen function, see Creating a Pipe. 
There are also symbolic constants defined in unistd.h for the file descriptors belonging to the standard streams stdin, stdout, and stderr; see Standard Streams.
