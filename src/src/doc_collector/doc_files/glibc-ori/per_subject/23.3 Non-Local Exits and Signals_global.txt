In BSD Unix systems, setjmp and longjmp also save and restore the set of blocked signals; see Blocking Signals.  However, the POSIX.1 standard requires setjmp and longjmp not to change the set of blocked signals, and provides an additional pair of functions (sigsetjmp and siglongjmp) to get the BSD behavior. 
The behavior of setjmp and longjmp in the GNU C Library is controlled by feature test macros; see Feature Test Macros.  The default in the GNU C Library is the POSIX.1 behavior rather than the BSD behavior. 
The facilities in this section are declared in the header file setjmp.h.
