The database that keeps track of “well-known” services is usually either the file /etc/services or an equivalent from a name server. You can use these utilities, declared in netdb.h, to access the services database.  
To get information about a particular service, use the getservbyname or getservbyport functions.  The information is returned in a statically-allocated structure; you must copy the information if you need to save it across calls. 
You can also scan the services database using setservent, getservent and endservent.  Be careful when using these functions because they are not reentrant.
