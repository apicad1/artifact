- Macro: tcflag_t OPOST
If this bit is set, output data is processed in some unspecified way so that it is displayed appropriately on the terminal device.  This typically includes mapping newline characters ('\n') onto carriage return and linefeed pairs. 
If this bit isnâ€™t set, the characters are transmitted as-is.
