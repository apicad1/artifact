We mentioned above that the shell prints a message describing the signal that terminated a child process.  The clean way to print a message describing a signal is to use the functions strsignal and psignal.  These functions use a signal number to specify which kind of signal to describe.  The signal number may come from the termination status of a child process (see Process Completion) or it may come from a signal handler in the same process.
