Defining and using a variadic function involves three steps: 
  Define the function as variadic, using an ellipsis (‘…’) in the argument list, and using special macros to access the variable arguments.  See Receiving Arguments.   Declare the function as variadic, using a prototype with an ellipsis (‘…’), in all the files which call it. See Variadic Prototypes.   Call the function by writing the fixed arguments followed by the additional variable arguments.  See Calling Variadics.
