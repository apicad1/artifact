- ENAMETOOLONG
This error is used when either the total length of a file name is greater than PATH_MAX, or when an individual file name component has a length greater than NAME_MAX.  See Limits for Files. 
On GNU/Hurd systems, there is no imposed limit on overall file name length, but some file systems may place limits on the length of a component.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- ENOENT
This error is reported when a file referenced as a directory component in the file name doesn’t exist, or when a component is a symbolic link whose target file does not exist.  See Symbolic Links.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- ENOTDIR
A file that is referenced as a directory component in the file name exists, but it isn’t a directory.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- ELOOP
Too many symbolic links were resolved while trying to look up the file name.  The system has an arbitrary limit on the number of symbolic links that may be resolved in looking up a single file name, as a primitive way to detect loops.  See Symbolic Links.
