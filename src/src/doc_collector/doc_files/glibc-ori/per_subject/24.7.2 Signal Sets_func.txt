- Data Type: sigset_t
The sigset_t data type is used to represent a signal set. Internally, it may be implemented as either an integer or structure type. 
For portability, use only the functions described in this section to initialize, change, and retrieve information from sigset_t objects—don’t try to manipulate them directly.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- Function: int sigemptyset (sigset_t *set)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Safe  | AC-Safe  | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
This function initializes the signal set set to exclude all of the defined signals.  It always returns 0. 
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- Function: int sigfillset (sigset_t *set)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Safe  | AC-Safe  | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
This function initializes the signal set set to include all of the defined signals.  Again, the return value is 0. 
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- Function: int sigaddset (sigset_t *set, int signum)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Safe  | AC-Safe  | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
This function adds the signal signum to the signal set set. All sigaddset does is modify set; it does not block or unblock any signals. 
The return value is 0 on success and -1 on failure. The following errno error condition is defined for this function: 
	EINVAL
The signum argument doesn’t specify a valid signal. 
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- Function: int sigdelset (sigset_t *set, int signum)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Safe  | AC-Safe  | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
This function removes the signal signum from the signal set set.  All sigdelset does is modify set; it does not block or unblock any signals.  The return value and error conditions are the same as for sigaddset. 
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- Function: int sigismember (const sigset_t *set, int signum)
Preliminary: | MT-Safe  | AS-Safe  | AC-Safe  | See POSIX Safety Concepts. 
The sigismember function tests whether the signal signum is a member of the signal set set.  It returns 1 if the signal is in the set, 0 if not, and -1 if there is an error. 
The following errno error condition is defined for this function: 
	EINVAL
The signum argument doesn’t specify a valid signal.
